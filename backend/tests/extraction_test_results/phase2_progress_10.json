He was previously seen in our clinic on 3/17/2025 when we ordered a prostate MRI due to concerns about his PSA velocity. The MRI performed on 5/27/2025 revealed a PI-RADS 4 lesion in the right apical peripheral zone measuring 8 x 4 x 6 mm without evidence of extracapsular extension or enlarged pelvic lymph nodes. Today he presents to discuss MRI results and formulate a treatment plan. He continues to have mild lower urinary tract symptoms with nocturia being his primary complaint. For his ED, he currently uses sildenafil 100mg with limited effectiveness and is interested in exploring surgical options following his previous VED breaking. He reports recent onset of fatigue, and a recent Holter monitor from 6/24/2025 revealed first degree AV block and 3547 episodes of second degree AV block (Mobitz II), for which he has been referred to cardiology.\n\n\n+---------------+------+\n|        IPSS          |\n+---------------+------+\n| Symptom       | 6/30 |\n+---------------+------+\n| Empty         |  1   |\n| Frequency     |  3   |\n| Urgency       |  1   |\n| Hesitancy     |  0   |\n| Intermittency |  0   |\n| Flow          |  0   |\n| Nocturia      |  4   |\n+---------------+------+\n| Total         | 9/35 |\n| BI            | 2/6  |\n+---------------+------+\n\nDIETARY HISTORY: Patient reports following a low carb diet for diabetes management and minimizing salt intake for blood pressure control. He tries to limit evening fluids to manage nocturia.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Former tobacco user during military service over 20 years ago. Current alcohol use is 2-3 beers with dinner once weekly. He is employed as a safety professional. Lives with his girlfriend and plans to get married soon.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: No family history of urologic cancer. Mother had diabetes. Father had HTN and CAD with MI in his 50s and died of stroke. Brother died of diabetic complications in January 2020.\n\nSEXUAL HISTORY: Reports longstanding ED, previously treated with VED for more than 10 years until the device broke. Currently uses sildenafil 100mg with limited effectiveness. He desires more reliable erectile function and has expressed interest in an implantable penile prosthesis (IPP).\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Hammer toe - August 15, 2024\n2.

His cardiac comorbidities, specifically the newly diagnosed second-degree AV block, require cardiology clearance before any urological interventions. His other comorbidities including diabetes, cirrhosis with thrombocytopenia, and obesity increase his surgical risk and may impact treatment decisions.\n\n\nProblem #1: PI-RADS 4 lesion on prostate MRI with elevated PSA\nProblem #2: BPH with mild LUTS\nProblem #3: Medication-refractory erectile dysfunction\nProblem #4: Newly diagnosed cardiac conduction abnormalities\n\n\nPLAN:\n\n1. For PI-RADS 4 lesion with elevated PSA:\n   - Schedule MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy targeting the 8 x 4 x 6 mm lesion in the anterior right apical peripheral zone plus standard systematic sampling\n   - Will need cardiac clearance before invasive procedures given recent finding of significant conduction abnormalities\n   - Discussed risks of biopsy including bleeding, infection, urinary retention, and need for antibiotic prophylaxis\n   - Discussed risk stratification approach and potential management options depending on biopsy results\n\n2. For BPH with mild LUTS:\n   - Continue conservative management with fluid restriction in evening hours\n   - Symptoms are mild and not significantly bothersome at this time; no medications indicated\n   - Will reassess after prostate biopsy results are known, as findings may impact BPH management\n\n3. For erectile dysfunction:\n   - Defer evaluation for implantable penile prosthesis until after prostate biopsy results and cardiac workup\n   - Continue sildenafil 100mg as needed in the interim\n   - Discussed importance of optimal diabetes control for any future surgical intervention\n\n4. For cardiac issues:\n   - Defer all invasive urological procedures pending cardiology evaluation for newly diagnosed second degree AV block\n   - Contact cardiology to expedite evaluation due to potential need for urological interventions\n   - Patient to alert us when he has completed cardiology workup\n\n5.

No palpable penile plaque.  The scrotum is without masses. \n Both testicles are descended and without appreciable mass or tenderness.  There \n are no appreciable urethral or perineal masses. No evidence of hydrocele or \n hernia.\n Neurologic: Grossly intact. \n Skin: No rashes or lesions.\n Psychiatric: Alert and oriented to person and place with normal affect. \n \n A/P: 65M with hx of ED refractory to VED and Cialis. \n \n During our visit today, we discussed the etiologies of erectile dysfunction \n including: vasculogenic (arterial insufficiency and/or venous leak), neurogenic, \n psychogenic (depression, stress, and/or anxiety), endocrine-related problems, \n and medication-induced (including specific antihypertensives and \n antidepressants). We discussed the risk of alcohol and tobacco abuse and chronic \n medical diseases such as diabetes, chronic renal failure, and coronary artery \n disease and their relationship with erectile dysfunction.  A history of pelvic \n surgery and/or surgery on associated male genitourinary organs can also cause \n erectile dysfunction.  Additionally, traumatic injury to the pelvis and/or \n genitourinary organs can cause erectile dysfunction.\n \n Erectile dysfunction medications: We discussed the utilization of \n phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction such as Viagra, Cialis and \n Levitra.  I discussed with the patient the side effect profile of these \n medications. \n \n We discussed alternative treatment strategies such as vacuum erection device \n (VED), intracavernosal injections (ICI), and medicated urethral system for \n erections (MUSE). We discussed the risks and benefits of each. \n \n Finally, we discussed inflatable penile implants at great length.  We discussed \n some of the different features of these including the pump, the reservoir, and \n the cylinders.  I explained the implantation method through a penoscrotal \n incision, dilation of the corpora cavernosa, measurement of the penile size, \n selection of appropriate implant size, placement of the reservoir, and placement \n of the pump.  We discussed some of the expectations about the effectiveness of \n the device.  It should make the penis rigid upon demand, for an indefinite \n period of time. \n \n We discussed some of the risks and benefits including the risk of infection of \n an implant (1-2% requiring removal of the device and salvage antibiotic \n treatment with replacement of a new device, the latter being successful 50-85% \n of time); bleeding (small risk of scrotal hematoma and swelling); mechanical \n failure (5% at 5 years, significantly greater by 10-15 years); penile shortening \n (although we will put in as long a device as the penis can accommodate); \n adjacent organ injury (less than 1% risk of bladder or urethral injury, each of \n which generally requires termination of the implant procedure and return on \n another visit); as well as the general risks of surgery in an older man \n including risks of pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, \n venous thromboembolism, and the like. I also discussed patient and partner \n satisfaction, and I explained the satisfaction rates from clinical trials for \n patient and partner satisfaction levels are in the 90+% range.\n \n **Patient is interested in IPP, but wants to discuss with wife. Educational \n handouts provided. In the meantime, he would like to try Viagra 100 mg prn \n sexual activity. Admin instructions and side effects thoroughly discussed. He \n knows not to take it concurrently with Cialis. \n \n RTC in March as schedule with Dr. Rodriguez. RTC with me prn. If he decides \n sooner than March that he would like to proceed with IPP, he was instructed to \n call the clinic and let us know.**\n  \n /es/ ALEXANDER T.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms \n (LUTS):\n    - The patient has a history of BPH with current LUTS with moderate symptoms.\n    - The patient is currently not on any prostate medications.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED):\n    - The patient has longstanding ED, previously managed with a vacuum erection \n device (VED)+/- Oral agents.  The VED has recently broken.  Will reorder\n \n 3. PSA Monitoring:\n    - PSA levels have shown a slight increase over the years but remain within a \n range that is not immediately concerning for malignancy, considering age and \n history.\n \n 4. Renal Cystic lesion:\n    - Thought to be resolving hemorrhagic cyst.  No further imaging was \n recommended.\n \n PLAN:\n \n 1. Management of BPH and LUTS:\n    - Medications: Currently he isnt bothered enough for medical therapy.\n    - Monitoring: Follow-up with IPSS scores to assess symptom improvement or the \n need for additional interventions.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Management:\n    - VED Replacement: Since the patient prefers a VED, facilitate the \n replacement of the broken device. Educate the patient on correct usage and \n maintenance.  He is also interested in potential IPP.\n    - Pharmacotherapy: The patient is already prescribed tadalafil. Ensure \n adherence and evaluate effectiveness. Consider alternative medications or \n combination therapy if necessary.\n \n 3. PSA and Prostate Health:\n    - Continue regular PSA monitoring given the history of BPH and age-related \n risk. No immediate need for biopsy unless PSA levels rise significantly or \n symptoms suggest malignancy.\n  \n 4. Lifestyle and Supportive Care:\n    - Encourage weight management and lifestyle modifications to improve overall \n health, which might also impact LUTS and ED positively.\n    - Discuss the potential impact of alcohol on liver disease progression and \n overall health, reinforcing previous counseling.\n \n I will send to Dr. Rozanski to evaluate him for potential IPP.  The patient \n seems motivated for a possible IPP, but we did discuss his DM putting him at \n risk for potential complications such as postop infection.\n \n RTC 6 months to confirm a more recent PSA measurement, and also to followup on \n his progress with the VED or IPP.\n \n Time of Start:10:50 AM\n Time End: 11:30 AM\n Time Spent in Chart prep, review, interpretation, & documentation: See Below\n Total Time Spent:40 minutes\n \n  \n /es/ RONALD RODRIGUEZ\n MD/Urology\n Signed: 09/16/2024 11:29\nFacility: AUDIE L.

We discussed the risk of alcohol and tobacco abuse and chronic \n medical diseases such as diabetes, chronic renal failure, and coronary artery \n disease and their relationship with erectile dysfunction.  A history of pelvic \n surgery and/or surgery on associated male genitourinary organs can also cause \n erectile dysfunction.  Additionally, traumatic injury to the pelvis and/or \n genitourinary organs can cause erectile dysfunction.\n \n Erectile dysfunction medications: We discussed the utilization of \n phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction such as Viagra, Cialis and \n Levitra.  I discussed with the patient the side effect profile of these \n medications. \n \n We discussed alternative treatment strategies such as vacuum erection device \n (VED), intracavernosal injections (ICI), and medicated urethral system for \n erections (MUSE). We discussed the risks and benefits of each. \n \n Finally, we discussed inflatable penile implants at great length.  We discussed \n some of the different features of these including the pump, the reservoir, and \n the cylinders.  I explained the implantation method through a penoscrotal \n incision, dilation of the corpora cavernosa, measurement of the penile size, \n selection of appropriate implant size, placement of the reservoir, and placement \n of the pump.  We discussed some of the expectations about the effectiveness of \n the device.  It should make the penis rigid upon demand, for an indefinite \n period of time. \n \n We discussed some of the risks and benefits including the risk of infection of \n an implant (1-2% requiring removal of the device and salvage antibiotic \n treatment with replacement of a new device, the latter being successful 50-85% \n of time); bleeding (small risk of scrotal hematoma and swelling); mechanical \n failure (5% at 5 years, significantly greater by 10-15 years); penile shortening \n (although we will put in as long a device as the penis can accommodate); \n adjacent organ injury (less than 1% risk of bladder or urethral injury, each of \n which generally requires termination of the implant procedure and return on \n another visit); as well as the general risks of surgery in an older man \n including risks of pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, \n venous thromboembolism, and the like. I also discussed patient and partner \n satisfaction, and I explained the satisfaction rates from clinical trials for \n patient and partner satisfaction levels are in the 90+% range.\n \n **Patient is interested in IPP, but wants to discuss with wife. Educational \n handouts provided. In the meantime, he would like to try Viagra 100 mg prn \n sexual activity. Admin instructions and side effects thoroughly discussed. He \n knows not to take it concurrently with Cialis. \n \n RTC in March as schedule with Dr. Rodriguez. RTC with me prn. If he decides \n sooner than March that he would like to proceed with IPP, he was instructed to \n call the clinic and let us know.**\n  \n /es/ ALEXANDER T.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms \n (LUTS):\n    - The patient has a history of BPH with current LUTS with moderate symptoms.\n    - The patient is currently not on any prostate medications.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED):\n    - The patient has longstanding ED, previously managed with a vacuum erection \n device (VED)+/- Oral agents.  The VED has recently broken.  Will reorder\n \n 3. PSA Monitoring:\n    - PSA levels have shown a slight increase over the years but remain within a \n range that is not immediately concerning for malignancy, considering age and \n history.\n \n 4. Renal Cystic lesion:\n    - Thought to be resolving hemorrhagic cyst.  No further imaging was \n recommended.\n \n PLAN:\n \n 1. Management of BPH and LUTS:\n    - Medications: Currently he isnt bothered enough for medical therapy.\n    - Monitoring: Follow-up with IPSS scores to assess symptom improvement or the \n need for additional interventions.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Management:\n    - VED Replacement: Since the patient prefers a VED, facilitate the \n replacement of the broken device. Educate the patient on correct usage and \n maintenance.  He is also interested in potential IPP.\n    - Pharmacotherapy: The patient is already prescribed tadalafil. Ensure \n adherence and evaluate effectiveness. Consider alternative medications or \n combination therapy if necessary.\n \n 3. PSA and Prostate Health:\n    - Continue regular PSA monitoring given the history of BPH and age-related \n risk. No immediate need for biopsy unless PSA levels rise significantly or \n symptoms suggest malignancy.\n  \n 4. Lifestyle and Supportive Care:\n    - Encourage weight management and lifestyle modifications to improve overall \n health, which might also impact LUTS and ED positively.\n    - Discuss the potential impact of alcohol on liver disease progression and \n overall health, reinforcing previous counseling.\n \n I will send to Dr. Rozanski to evaluate him for potential IPP.  The patient \n seems motivated for a possible IPP, but we did discuss his DM putting him at \n risk for potential complications such as postop infection.\n \n RTC 6 months to confirm a more recent PSA measurement, and also to followup on \n his progress with the VED or IPP.\n \n Time of Start:10:50 AM\n Time End: 11:30 AM\n Time Spent in Chart prep, review, interpretation, & documentation: See Below\n Total Time Spent:40 minutes\n \n  \n /es/ RONALD RODRIGUEZ\n MD/Urology\n Signed: 09/16/2024 11:29\nFacility: AUDIE L.

He has a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis with metabolic abnormalities. His primary hyperparathyroidism was addressed surgically in February 2025 with a right hemithyroidectomy and removal of parathyroid adenoma, which incidentally found a 4.5mm papillary thyroid carcinoma (T1a with negative margins). Recent CT scan from June 2025 showed no urolithiasis, representing improvement from previous imaging. He also has a history of stable Bosniak II cyst in the left kidney.\n\nThe patient continues to have erectile dysfunction but is not currently seeking treatment as he reports he doesn't have sex currently. He also reports mild BPH symptoms with an IPSS score of 2/35 and bother index of 1/6. He is currently managed on prazosin 5mg daily (originally prescribed for PTSD nightmares).\n\nHe recently had severe hypoglycemia in May 2025 with a glucose level of 46 mg/dL, and has had multiple episodes of AM hypoglycemia. He is wearing a CGM for glucose monitoring.\n\n+---------------+------+\n|        IPSS          |\n+---------------+------+\n| Symptom       | 6/30 |\n+---------------+------+\n| Empty         |  0   |\n| Frequency     |  0   |\n| Urgency       |  0   |\n| Hesitancy     |  1   |\n| Intermittency |  0   |\n| Flow          |  1   |\n| Nocturia      |  0   |\n+---------------+------+\n| Total         | 2/35 |\n| BI            | 1/6  |\n+---------------+------+\n\n DIETARY HISTORY:\nNo coffee consumption.

His most recent CT scan now shows no evidence of kidney stones, suggesting his treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism has successfully addressed his stone disease. His mild BPH symptoms are well-controlled on prazosin, which was initially prescribed for his PTSD. His erectile dysfunction is currently not being treated as he reports no interest in sexual activity at this time. He has multiple medical comorbidities that are being managed by other providers, including poorly controlled diabetes with hypoglycemic episodes, and is going through personal challenges with a divorce.\n\n Problem #1:\nNephrolithiasis - Previously had metabolic abnormalities including hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, and hyperuricosuria. Status post parathyroidectomy with resolution of kidney stones on recent imaging, suggesting successful treatment of the underlying hyperparathyroidism.\n\n Problem #2:\nRenal Cysts - Stable Bosniak II cyst in the left kidney, unchanged on recent imaging and requiring continued surveillance but no intervention.\n\n Problem #3:\nErectile Dysfunction - Longstanding issue currently not requiring treatment per patient preference. Likely multifactorial etiology including age, diabetes, medications (particularly spironolactone which has antiandrogen effects), and psychological factors.\n\n PLAN:\n\n1. Nephrolithiasis Management:\n   - Continue current dietary modifications with focus on:\n     - Maintaining high fluid intake (>2.5 L/day)\n     - Low sodium diet (<2000 mg/day)\n     - Limited oxalate intake\n     - Adequate dietary calcium with meals\n   - No kidney stones present on current imaging, indicating resolution after parathyroidectomy\n   - Repeat 24-hour urine collection in 3 months to assess metabolic parameters post-parathyroidectomy\n   - Follow-up CT scan in 12 months to ensure continued absence of stones\n\n2. Renal Cyst Management:\n   - Continue surveillance with annual imaging (alternating ultrasound and CT)\n   - No specific intervention required as the Bosniak II cyst has been stable\n\n3. Erectile Dysfunction:\n   - Currently deferred per patient preference as he is not sexually active\n   - Discussed potential contribution of spironolactone (antiandrogen effects) to ED and recommended discussion with PCP about potentially changing this medication\n   - Will revisit treatment options if patient's interest changes\n   - Note that any PDE5 inhibitor treatment would require caution given his cardiac medications and history of atrial fibrillation\n\n4. Mild BPH:\n   - Continue current management with prazosin 5mg nightly\n   - IPSS score remains low at 2/35 with minimal bother (1/6)\n   - No need for additional BPH medications at this time\n\n5. Follow-up:\n   - Return to clinic in 3 months with 24-hour urine collection prior to visit\n   - Encourage follow-up with endocrinology for diabetes management given recent hypoglycemic episodes\n   - Recommend sleep study follow-up as previously ordered by endocrinology\n\nPatient was counseled on the importance of continuing dietary modifications for stone prevention and diabetic management. He verbalized understanding of the plan and agreed to complete the follow-up testing prior to next appointment.\n",

Based\n       on the United States FRAX calculator, the patient's 10 year\n       probability of major osteoporotic fracture is 7.8% and 10 year\n       probability of hip fracture is 2.0%. \n       According to the World Health Organization guidelines,\n       osteoporosis may be diagnosed if the lowest T-score of the lumbar\n       spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or less.  Low bone\n       density (osteopenia) may be diagnosed if the T-score falls\n       between -1.0 and -2.5.  In certain circumstances the 33% radius\n       (also called 1/3rd radius) may be utilized.  \n       Osteoporosis may be diagnosed in men age 50 and older if the\n       T-score of the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or\n       less.  \n       RECOMMENDATIONS: \n       1.  If therapy is contemplated, mild to aggressive therapies are \n       available.  Additionally, all patients should ensure an adequate \n       intake of dietary calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (400-800 IU \n       daily).  \n       2.  The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) guidelines\n       recommend initiating therapy to reduce fracture risk in\n       postmenopausal women or men over age 50 with BMD: - T-score below\n       -2.5 SD; - or T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD if the 10-year\n       probability of hip fracture is >3% or a 10-year probability of a\n       major osteoporosis-related fracture is >20% based on the\n       U.S.-adapted WHO algorithm; - or presence of a fragility\n       fracture.  \n       3. Patients with diagnosed cases of osteoporosis or low bone\n       density (osteopenia) should be regularly tested for bone mineral\n       density.  For patients eligible for Medicare, routine testing is\n       allowed once every 2 years.  Testing frequency can be increased\n       for patients with rapidly progressing disease, or for those who\n       are receiving medical therapy to restore bone mass.  \n       COMMENTS: \n       The technical quality of the study is good.  \n     Primary Diagnostic Code: \n Primary Interpreting Staff:\n   DIANE M ICENOGLE-LEUSCHEN, MD RADIOLOGIST (Verifier)\n /DMI\n===============================================================================\nPrinted at:\nAUDIE L.

Mild atelectasis in both lung bases. \n  \n \n IMPRESSION:\n 1. Penicillin allergic reaction, remote hx, 60 yrs ago. \n -Today's skin test and oral challenge are NEGATIVE. \n -Will remove this allergy from postings. \n -Pt is free to use beta-lactam abx when needed. \n \n 2. Iron dextran post-reaction tryptase level is higher than expected. \n -Pt's tryptase level, though done 2 days after the initial reaction \n is higher than expected for a serum baseline tryptase, and suggests a mast cell \n mediated event. \n -Pt did not obtain repeat tryptase level on 9/6/24. \n -*It is now advised that serum baseline tyrptase levels >8.0 be investigated for \n underlying mast cell disease. Will repeat SB tryptase level and if it remains \n above 8.0, will initiate an eval for underlying MC ds.\n \n 3. Iron dextran anaphylaxis (occured 8/13/24).\n -Pt hx is most consistent with this diagnosis. This initial event m/l lead \n 2ndarily to the cardiogenic shock. \n -After a brief review of the literature, there are documented iron \n desensitization protocols available. \n ***However, the pt voiced significant concern about ever receiving an iron \n infusion again and would like to consider blood tranfusions to manage his \n anemia, in the future instead, if needed. Advised pt to discuss this further \n with his nephrologist and hepatologist. \n \n 4.

No audible wheezes.\n Neurologic: Grossly intact. \n Skin: No rashes or lesions.\n Psychiatric: Alert and oriented to person and place with normal affect. \n A/P: 81M with organic ED. \n During our visit today, we discussed the etiologies of erectile dysfunction \n including: vasculogenic (arterial insufficiency and/or venous leak), \n neurogenic, psychogenic (depression, stress, and/or anxiety), endocrine-\n related problems, and medication-induced (including specific \n antihypertensives and antidepressants). We discussed the risk of alcohol and \n tobacco abuse and chronic medical diseases such as diabetes, chronic renal \n failure, and coronary artery disease and their relationship with erectile \n dysfunction.  A history of pelvic surgery and/or surgery on associated male \n genitourinary organs can also cause erectile dysfunction.  Additionally, \n traumatic injury to the pelvis and/or genitourinary organs can cause erectile \n dysfunction.\n Erectile dysfunction medications: We discussed the utilization of \n phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction such as Viagra, Cialis \n and Levitra.  I discussed with the patient the side effect profile of these \n medications. \n We discussed alternative treatment strategies such as vacuum erection device \n (VED), intracavernosal injections (ICI), and medicated urethral system for \n erections (MUSE). We discussed the risks and benefits of each. \n Finally, we discussed inflatable penile implants at great length.  We \n discussed some of the different features of these including the pump, the \n reservoir, and the cylinders.  I explained the implantation method through a \n penoscrotal incision, dilation of the corpora cavernosa, measurement of the \n penile size, selection of appropriate implant size, placement of the \n reservoir, and placement of the pump.  We discussed some of the expectations \n about the effectiveness of the device.  It should make the penis rigid upon \n demand, for an indefinite period of time. \n We discussed some of the risks and benefits including the risk of infection \n of an implant (1-2% requiring removal of the device and salvage antibiotic \n treatment with replacement of a new device, the latter being successful 50-\n 85% of time); bleeding (small risk of scrotal hematoma and swelling); \n mechanical failure (5% at 5 years, significantly greater by 10-15 years); \n penile shortening (although we will put in as long a device as the penis can \n accommodate); adjacent organ injury (less than 1% risk of bladder or urethral \n injury, each of which generally requires termination of the implant procedure \n and return on another visit); as well as the general risks of surgery in an \n older man including risks of pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial \n infarction, venous thromboembolism, and the like. I also discussed patient \n and partner satisfaction, and I explained the satisfaction rates from \n clinical trials for patient and partner satisfaction levels are in the 90+% \n range.\n **Patient is not interested IPP surgery or ICI. Wants to continue Levitra 20 \n mg prn sexual activity. Admin instructions and side effects discussed. RTC \n prn in prosthetics clinic.

Based on \n       the United States FRAX calculator, the patient's 10 year \n       probability of major osteoporotic fracture is 3.3% and 10 year \n       probability of hip fracture is 1.2%. \n       According to the World Health Organization guidelines, \n       osteoporosis may be diagnosed if the lowest T-score of the lumbar \n       spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or less.  Low bone \n       density (osteopenia) may be diagnosed if the T-score falls \n       between -1.0 and -2.5.  In certain circumstances the 33% radius \n       (also called 1/3rd radius) may be utilized.  \n       Osteoporosis may be diagnosed in men age 50 and older if the \n       T-score of the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or \n       less.  \n       RECOMMENDATIONS: \n       1.  If therapy is contemplated, mild to aggressive therapies are \n       available.  Additionally, all patients should ensure an adequate \n       intake of dietary calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (400-800 IU \n       daily).  \n       2.  The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) guidelines \n       recommend initiating therapy to reduce fracture risk in \n       postmenopausal women or men over age 50 with BMD: - T-score below\n       -2.5 SD; - or T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD if the 10-year\n       probability of hip fracture is >3% or a 10-year probability of a\n       major osteoporosis-related fracture is >20% based on the\n       U.S.-adapted WHO algorithm; - or presence of a fragility\n       fracture.  \n       3. Patients with diagnosed cases of osteoporosis or low bone \n       density (osteopenia) should be regularly tested for bone mineral \n       density.  For patients eligible for Medicare, routine testing is \n       allowed once every 2 years.  Testing frequency can be increased \n       for patients with rapidly progressing disease, or for those who \n       are receiving medical therapy to restore bone mass.  \n       COMMENTS: \n       The technical quality of the study is good.  \n       Signed by Diane Icenogle-Leuschen on 3/29/2023 11:18 AM CDT \n     Primary Diagnostic Code: \n Primary Interpreting Staff:\n   DIANE M ICENOGLE-LEUSCHEN, MD RADIOLOGIST (Verifier)\n /DMI\n===============================================================================\nDetailed Report\n US, RETROPERITONEAL LTD (RENAL, AORTA, NODES)\n Proc Ord: VASCULAR STUDY ART/VEN ABD/PEL OR RETROPERITONEAL, COMPLETE\n Exm Date: NOV 30, 2015@11:55\n Req Phys: STITELER,AMANDA P              Pat Loc: ZZALM GU TUMOR RES2 2M (Req'g \n                                          Img Loc: ULTRASOUND\n                                          Service: Unknown\n                              AUDIE L.

Subsequently, 10 minute\n       delayed excretory images of the entire urinary tract were\n       obtained.  \n       FINDINGS: \n       There is a 6.2 x 4.9 cm expansile, soft tissue mass with\n       heterogeneous enhancement in the lower pole of the left kidney.  \n       A 1.5 cm high attenuating lesion with subtle enhancement is also\n       noted in the interpolar region of the left kidney. The renal\n       veins and IVC are patent. No significant regional lymphadenopathy\n       is seen. There are no urinary tract stones.     Excretory images\n       demonstrate the urinary tract well with no evidence of filling\n       defects in the ureters or bladder.  The prostate gland is\n       enlarged and demonstrates mass effect on the posterior bladder.\n       Small bladder diverticula are noted posteriorly.  \n       The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas\n       appear normal.   No free air or free fluid is seen in the abdomen\n       or pelvis.  Diverticula are seen in the sigmoid and descending\n       colon without adjacent fat stranding.   The appendix is normal.  \n       The overlying soft tissues are without focal abnormality.   No \n       destructive osseous lesions are seen.  \n       There is a 6 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe.  \n     Impression:\n        1. Left renal lower pole mass consistent with renal cell\n       carcinoma.  2.   Subtle enhancing lesion in the interpolar region\n       of the left kidney may represent a hemorrhagic cyst or neoplasm.  \n       3.   Right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.

He was diagnosed in September 2024 with GG4 cT2b high-risk prostate cancer. Following his diagnosis, he opted for radiation therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). He received his first Eligard (leuprolide) 45mg injection in December 2024 and completed his radiation treatments in March 2025, receiving 60 Gy in 20 fractions. His most recent PSA on 6/3/2025 is 0.01, demonstrating excellent response to treatment. However, he continues to struggle with significant side effects from the ADT, including severe irritability, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and worsening of his underlying PTSD. He also reports rectal urgency and diarrhea following radiation therapy. He had bilateral conjunctivitis treated in the ER on 6/20/2025 with complete resolution. He has no hematuria or new bone pain. Recent testosterone level shows continued castrate levels (<10). The patient is now due for his second Eligard injection, but given his significant side effects, we will need to discuss whether to continue with ADT. He also recently visited the ER on 4/28/25 for fever and bodyaches which was diagnosed as a viral syndrome.\n\n+---------------+------+\n|        IPSS          |\n+---------------+------+\n| Date          |6/30/25|\n+---------------+------+\n| Empty         |  2   |\n| Frequency     |  3   |\n| Urgency       |  2   |\n| Hesitancy     |  1   |\n| Intermittency |  1   |\n| Flow          |  1   |\n| Nocturia      |  1   |\n+---------------+------+\n| Total         |11/35 |\n| BI            | 3/6  |\n+---------------+------+\n\nDIETARY HISTORY: Coffee- 20-30 oz daily (about 8 cups worth).

No PSMA PET avid sites of metastatic disease.\n\nMRI Prostate (7/25/2024): Lesion in the anterior right mid gland stable since 2021 (PI-RADS 2). No new prostate lesion, evidence of extracapsular extension, or pelvic adenopathy.\n\nCT Chest (4/17/2025): Redemonstrated cavitation with wall thickening in right lower lobe, mildly more conspicuous than seen on prior exam. Other area of cavitation and parenchymal calcification in right lower lobe is similar. Continued surveillance recommended.\n\nCT Pelvis W/O Contrast (1/29/2025): No evidence of metastatic disease in the pelvis. Performed for radiation therapy simulation.\n\nGENERAL ROS:\nGen: Independent ADL's, No fever, chills, recent weight loss\nEENT: No recent visual changes, no stiff neck or limited range of motion\nDerm: No abnormal or changing skin lesions\nCV: No chest pain at rest; No palpitations, No syncope, No claudication, No PND; No easy bleeding or bruising\nRESP: Reports occasional shortness of breath, especially with exertion\nGI: Reports diarrhea, rectal urgency post-radiation\nGU: See HPI\nMSK: No new bone pain\nNeuro: No headache, syncope, dizziness\nPsych: Reports significant depression, anxiety, and irritability related to ADT\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\n06/30/25\n14:30\n    T:   98.0 F (36.7 C)\n    P:   78\n    R:   18\n    B/P: 125/70\n    Ht:  66.00 in (167.64 cm)\n    Wt:  184.00 lb (83.46 kg)\n    Body Mass Index: 30\n    Pulse Oximetry: 98%\n    Pain: 1/10\n\nGENERAL: Well-developed, well-nourished gentleman with appropriate orientation, mood, affect, demeanor, and dress.\nHEENT: Normal symmetric, non-tender neck without mass/thyromegaly to palpation\nCHEST: Normal respiratory effort; no gynecomastia or masses.\nABDOMEN: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, without masses or organomegaly.

He is responding very well to treatment with PSA now undetectable (0.01). He continues to have significant ADT side effects including depression, irritability, fatigue, and worsening of his underlying PTSD. Given his excellent response to therapy and significant quality of life impact from ADT, discontinuation of hormone therapy is reasonable at this time, especially since he has already received nearly 7 months of treatment. He also has a history of liver cirrhosis with stable liver function, diabetes with adequate control, and a pulmonary nodule that appears stable, though with slightly increased wall thickening requiring continued surveillance.\n\nProblem #1: Prostate cancer, high risk (GG4, cT2b) - excellent response to radiation therapy and ADT.\nProblem #2: ADT side effects - severe enough to discontinue therapy at this time.\nProblem #3: Type 2 DM - HbA1c 6.4%, continue current management.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Discontinue ADT at this time given significant side effects and excellent PSA response.\n2. Continue calcium/vitamin D supplementation to support bone health.\n3. Follow PSA every 3 months; if PSA begins to rise significantly, will reconsider ADT options.\n4. Continue pulmonary nodule monitoring with follow-up CT chest in 6 months.\n5. Refill all current medications including tadalafil for ED.\n6. Follow up in urology clinic in 3 months with pre-visit PSA and testosterone.\n7. Consider psychiatric consultation for management of depression and PTSD if symptoms don't improve after ADT discontinuation.\n8. Continue to monitor liver status with regular labs, next set in 3 months.\n\nEND DIALOGUE\n",

This measures \n       8 x 8 x 8.5 mm (AP, TR, CC) compared to measurements of 8 x 6.5 x \n       8.5 mm previously. The lateral/transverse dimensions of the \n       nodules are greater compared to previous.  \n       Mild to moderate emphysema. Computer-aided detection did not \n       identify any other significant new lung nodules.  No pleural\n       effusion or pneumothorax.  \n       Osseous Structures: No acute process and no destructive lesions.  \n       Soft Tissues: Gynecomastia.  \n       Upper Abdomen: No acute findings in the partially visualized \n       abdomen.  \n     Impression:\n       1.  The left upper lobe nodule abutting the left oblique fissure \n       is mildly more prominent in the transverse dimension on this exam \n       compared to previous and the effect of tenting of the fissure is \n       more conspicuous as compared to CT chest 6/8/2023. Neoplasm not \n       excluded, continued close imaging surveillance or additional \n       evaluation as clinically appropriate.  \n       Signed by Jason M Au on 6/10/2024 3:02 PM CDT \n     Primary Diagnostic Code: POSSIBLE MALIGNANCY\n Primary Interpreting Staff:\n   JASON MING SUN AU, MD/Diagnostic Radiology (Verifier)\n /JMA\n===============================================================================\nDetailed Report\n CT ABD & PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST\n Exm Date: MAR 15, 2023@16:20\n Req Phys: GOLDHAGEN,MARC V               Pat Loc: ALM EMERGENCY DEPT (Req'g Loc)\n                                          Img Loc: CT SCAN\n                                          Service: Unknown\n                              AUDIE L.

He has a history of left spermatocele/hydrocele for which he underwent surgery on 6/10/2022 with an unremarkable postoperative course. He was noted to have a urinary tract infection with ascending infection to the right upper tract in July 2023, at which time his PSA was elevated at 4.28 ng/mL. Since then, his PSA has normalized with values of 1.84 ng/mL (10/2023), 1.30 ng/mL (7/2024), and most recently 1.00 ng/mL (6/2025). Recent CT abdomen/pelvis from 3/6/2025 showed no lymphadenopathy, confirming resolution of previously seen retroperitoneal lymph nodes that were likely inflammatory in nature.\n\nHe denies any current difficulties with urination. Stream is medium-strong in intensity. He denies intermittency, straining, hesitancy, sensation of incomplete emptying, hematuria, dysuria, frequency, or interval UTIs since he was last seen. He occasionally wakes once nightly to urinate.\n\n+---------------+------+\n|        IPSS          |\n+---------------+------+\n| Symptom       | 6/30 |\n+---------------+------+\n| Empty         |  0   |\n| Frequency     |  1   |\n| Urgency       |  0   |\n| Hesitancy     |  0   |\n| Intermittency |  0   |\n| Flow          |  0   |\n| Nocturia      |  1   |\n+---------------+------+\n| Total         | 2/35 |\n| BI            | 1/6  |\n+---------------+------+\n\nDIETARY HISTORY: Working on eating healthier and has lost some weight.

He had a history of acute pyelonephritis with transient PSA elevation in July 2023, which has since normalized with his most recent PSA at 1.00 ng/mL. Previous retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy has resolved, confirming the inflammatory etiology. His current urinary symptoms are minimal with an IPSS score of only 2/35, and he reports good erectile function with sildenafil when needed. Recent CT showed stable renal cysts with no concerning lesions.\n\n\nProblem #1: History of elevated PSA - Given the normalization of PSA and the absence of lymphadenopathy on recent imaging, the transient elevation appears to have been inflammatory in nature secondary to his urinary tract infection in 2023. Will continue monitoring with regular PSA checks.\n\nProblem #2: Mild LUTS - The patient reports minimal urinary symptoms with an IPSS score of 2/35. No medication needed at this time given the minimal symptomatology.\n\nProblem #3: Erectile dysfunction - Continue sildenafil 50mg as needed.\n\nProblem #4: History of atrial fibrillation - Diagnosed in August 2024, currently on metoprolol and apixaban for rate control and anticoagulation. Continue current management and follow with cardiology.\n\n\nPLAN:\n1. Continue monitoring PSA levels: repeat PSA in 6 months\n2. No pharmacological intervention needed for minimal LUTS at this time\n3. Continue sildenafil 50mg PRN for ED\n4. Follow up with urology in 6 months with PSA and urinalysis\n5. Follow up with cardiology regarding atrial fibrillation management\n6. Continue current medications including apixaban for atrial fibrillation\n7. Encourage continued weight loss efforts and healthy lifestyle changes to help with both urologic and cardiac health\n",

Approximately 5 cc of lidocaine 1% subcutaneous\n       for local anesthesia.  \n       CONSENT:  The risks, benefits and alternatives were explained and \n       all questions were answered to satisfaction before getting \n       informed and written consent. All labs and prior studies were \n       reviewed. Before beginning the case, a time was conducted to \n       verify the patient's identity and confirm the planned procedure.  \n       DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was placed supine on the \n       bed and the neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile \n       fashion.  Using real-time ultrasound guidance a 25-gauge needle \n       was advanced into the target abnormality in the right parotid \n       gland after a small amount of anesthetic was administered.  A \n       total of 3 FNA passes were performed using direct visualization \n       during the procedure.  This was followed by aspirating 3 cc of \n       dark yellow fluid with a 20 ga needle.  Each pass received \n       immediate attention from the pathology service which was \n       available to determine if enough material had been sampled in \n       order to make sure a diagnosis could be made.  At the conclusion \n       of the procedure, the needle was withdrawn and a sterile dry \n       dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well \n       and left without immediate complication.  \n       COMPLICATIONS:  None.  \n       FINDINGS:  Multiple ultrasound images taken during the procedure \n       show the FNA needle within the target lesion in the right lobe of \n       the parotid.  A completion ultrasound shows no evidence of \n       hematoma. \n     Impression:\n       Successful target FNA and aspiration in this patient with a\n       suspicious right parotid nodule.

He was last seen in the Urology clinic on January 6, 2025, at which time his PSA had increased to 5.18 ng/mL (January 2025) from 3.74 ng/mL (March 2024). His PSA values have fluctuated in the past, with a peak of 6.32 ng/mL in February 2024, which later decreased. An MRI of the prostate performed in May 2024 was negative for suspicious lesions (PI-RADS 2). \n\nThe patient has a history of male hypogonadism with laboratory findings from January 2025 showing total testosterone of 420 ng/dL but a low free testosterone of 50 pg/mL. His endocrine evaluation showed FSH 2.7 mIU/mL and LH 2.2 mIU/mL, both within normal limits.\n\nHe continues to report erectile dysfunction, which is managed with sildenafil 100mg as needed, though he experiences headaches as a side effect. He reports he takes it on an empty stomach, which helps with effectiveness but still causes headaches.\n\nSince his last visit, the patient has recovered from a proximal humerus fracture that occurred while roller skating.

Despite this elevation, his prostate MRI from May 2024 was negative for suspicious lesions (PI-RADS 2). He has laboratory-confirmed hypogonadism with low free testosterone despite borderline-normal total testosterone, suggesting possible SHBG abnormality. His endocrine workup with normal LH and FSH suggests secondary hypogonadism. His lower urinary tract symptoms remain mild with IPSS of 4/35. His erectile dysfunction is adequately managed with sildenafil despite the side effect of headaches.\n\n Problem #1: Elevated PSA (5.18 ng/mL)\n- PSA has fluctuated over time, with recent increase from 3.74 to 5.18 ng/mL\n- MRI prostate in May 2024 was negative for suspicious lesions\n- Digital rectal examination today is negative for nodules or induration\n\n Problem #2: Secondary Hypogonadism\n- Total testosterone 420 ng/dL (normal), but free testosterone 50 pg/mL (low)\n- Normal LH/FSH levels suggest pituitary/hypothalamic etiology\n- Patient reports fatigue and sexual dysfunction consistent with hypogonadism\n\n Problem #3: Erectile Dysfunction\n- Well-managed with sildenafil 100mg, though with headache side effects\n- Likely multifactorial etiology including hypogonadism and vascular factors\n\n PLAN:\n\n1. Elevated PSA:\n   - Repeat PSA in 3 months to assess trend\n   - Consider prostate biopsy if PSA continues to rise or exceeds 6.0 ng/mL\n   - Discussed risks/benefits of biopsy versus continued monitoring; patient prefers monitoring at this time\n\n2. Secondary Hypogonadism:\n   - Given consistently low free testosterone and normal LH/FSH, will initiate testosterone replacement therapy\n   - Prescribed testosterone cypionate 200mg/mL, 1mL IM every 2 weeks\n   - Discussed risks including potential PSA increases, polycythemia, and cardiovascular effects\n   - Will monitor PSA, CBC, CMP, and testosterone levels 3 months after initiating therapy\n   - Patient counseled on administration technique\n\n3. Erectile Dysfunction:\n   - Continue sildenafil 100mg as needed\n   - Discussed alternative PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil, vardenafil) that might cause fewer headaches\n   - Patient prefers to continue current medication for now\n   - Testosterone replacement may improve erectile function\n\n4. Return to clinic in 3 months with repeat PSA, testosterone levels (total and free), CBC, and CMP\n   - Sooner if new symptoms develop\n\nPatient verbalizes understanding of the plan and all questions were addressed during today's visit.\n",

    "expected_output": "++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n# VA Clinic Note\n\nCC: Follow-up for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), BPH with LUTS, recurrent nephrolithiasis, and erectile dysfunction.\n\nHPI: \nMr. Lipari is a 59-year-old male with a history of BPH with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), recurrent nephrolithiasis, erectile dysfunction, and hypogonadism on testosterone replacement therapy. He was started on testosterone cypionate 200mg IM every 14 days on February 5, 2025, for hypogonadism with a baseline testosterone level of 137.43 ng/dL. Today he presents for follow-up of his TRT and other urologic conditions.\n\nThe patient reports feeling better since starting TRT, with improved energy levels and sexual drive, though erectile dysfunction persists. Recent labs show elevated estrogen levels at 353 pg/mL (normal 56-213), suggesting peripheral aromatization of testosterone to estrogen. His testosterone remains low (105 ng/dL) despite treatment. He continues to use a vacuum erection device (VED) for ED with some success, though he notes it's \"not ideal.\" \n\nRegarding his BPH with LUTS, he continues to have significant urinary symptoms, with a stable IPSS score of 18/35. He previously did not tolerate tamsulosin due to orthostatic hypotension and discontinued finasteride due to lack of improvement. He has also been unable to tolerate alfuzosin.\n\nFor his recurrent nephrolithiasis, imaging from February 2024 showed a stable 7mm nonobstructing left renal calculus. He denies current flank pain, hematuria, or dysuria.

His testosterone level remains low despite TRT, with elevated estrogen levels suggesting peripheral aromatization. His urinary symptoms are significant and multifactorial, and he has been unable to tolerate medical therapy for BPH. His nephrolithiasis is stable, and he continues with dietary modifications. His ED is being managed with a vacuum erection device with moderate success.\n\nProblem #1: Hypogonadism with suboptimal response to testosterone replacement therapy. Low testosterone (105 ng/dL) and elevated estrogen (353 pg/mL) despite being on testosterone cypionate 200mg IM every 14 days since February 2025.\n\nProblem #2: BPH with LUTS. Persistent moderate symptoms (IPSS 18/35) and inability to tolerate medical therapy due to side effects.\n\nProblem #3: Recurrent nephrolithiasis. Stable 7 mm left renal calculus with hyperoxaluria and high urinary sodium on previous 24-hour urine collection.\n\nPLAN:\n\n1. Hypogonadism:\n   - Adjust testosterone dosing regimen to address suboptimal response: increase testosterone cypionate to 250mg IM every 14 days.\n   - Add anastrozole 0.5mg twice weekly to address elevated estradiol levels from peripheral aromatization.\n   - Check comprehensive hormone panel in 12 weeks including total and free testosterone, estradiol, FSH, LH, SHBG, CBC, CMP.\n   - Continue monitoring PSA every 3-6 months while on TRT.\n   - Educate patient on potential side effects of TRT and anastrozole.\n\n2. BPH with LUTS:\n   - Given inability to tolerate medical therapy, proceed with scheduling cystoscopy and urodynamic studies to evaluate for possible surgical intervention.\n   - Obtain cardiology clearance prior to any surgical intervention given cardiovascular history.\n   - Continue to encourage dietary modifications that may help urinary symptoms (limiting caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods).\n   - Discuss realistic expectations regarding potential surgical options (TURP/HoLEP).\n\n3. Recurrent Nephrolithiasis:\n   - Continue dietary modifications (low sodium, low oxalate).\n   - Encourage fluid intake >2.5 L/day.\n   - Repeat 24-hour urine collection in 3 months.\n   - Renal ultrasound in 6 months to monitor stone burden.\n   - Consider empiric potassium citrate therapy to increase urinary citrate levels and inhibit stone formation.\n\n4. Erectile Dysfunction:\n   - Continue with vacuum erection device.\n   - Reassess efficacy and discuss techniques for optimal use.\n   - Consider intracavernosal injection therapy or urethral suppositories as alternatives if VED efficacy remains suboptimal.\n   - Discuss influence of TRT adjustments on erectile function.\n\n5. Follow-Up:\n   - Return to clinic in 12 weeks for testosterone level check and comprehensive evaluation of all urologic conditions.\n   - Continue close follow-up with PCP for blood pressure management.\n   - Call clinic for any worsening urinary symptoms, hematuria, flank pain, or concerns with testosterone therapy.\n   - Provided VA Urology clinic phone number for questions or concerns.\n",

He has a 3.8 cm right upper pole renal mass that has shown interval growth from 3.2 cm on prior imaging. Given his comorbidities, active surveillance has been the management approach with scheduled renal MRI for continued monitoring. His PSA shows a gradual increase over the past several years from 0.34 to 3.26 ng/mL, though still within normal range. His BPH symptoms appear stable on current medical therapy with finasteride and tamsulosin.\n\n Problem #1: Right Renal Mass\nActive surveillance for 3.8 cm right upper pole renal mass. Patient has scheduled renal MRI follow-up planned for June 2025 with subsequent urology appointment. Given patient's multiple medical comorbidities, continued surveillance is appropriate at this time. Advised patient about warning signs that would require urgent evaluation (gross hematuria, significant flank pain, unexplained weight loss, etc.).\n\n Problem #2: BPH with LUTS\nStatus post greenlight laser procedure approximately 10 years ago with current moderate symptoms (IPSS 15/35). Currently managed on tamsulosin 0.4mg BID and finasteride 5mg daily with stable symptoms. Will continue current medical therapy as patient reports symptomatic improvement.\n\n Problem #3: Rising PSA\nPSA has gradually increased from 0.34 in 2019 to 3.26 in July 2024, though remains within normal range. This may be due to BPH progression given lack of suspicious findings on prostate exam. Will continue to monitor PSA with follow-up testing in 6 months.\n\n PLAN:\n1. Continue active surveillance for right renal mass with MRI scheduled for June 2025\n2. Follow-up appointment after MRI to review results and management options\n3. Continue tamsulosin 0.4mg BID and finasteride 5mg daily for BPH\n4. Repeat PSA in 6 months\n5. Continue to coordinate care with cardiology given patient's recent cardiac interventions and anticoagulation management\n6. Advised patient to contact office for any worsening urinary symptoms, hematuria, or flank pain\n7. Return to clinic after MRI in June 2025 or sooner if symptoms arise\n",

D/t his medical comorbidities, this mass has been followed \n on active surveillance. It was noted to have some recent growth compared to \n original imaging and is currently 3.8 cm. He was originally scheduled for \n surveillance renal MRI 2/2025 that was recently rescheduled to 6/2025. Pt with \n GU follow up appt scheduled for after MRI. Pt was last seen 8/2024 where he was \n advised to continue with renal mass monitoring. He was hospitalized at ALM from \n 8/13-8/20 for undifferentiated shock and recently underwent placement of cardiac \n stents, a watchman device, and cardiac ablation. He reports doing \"good\" today. \n He denies dysuria, hematuria, and flank pain. He reports compliance with \n tamsulosin BID and finasteride. Pt was scheduled today to follow up on renal MRI \n but this scan has been rescheduled for 6/2025 with subsequent GU flwp 12 days \n afterward.

Based\n       on the United States FRAX calculator, the patient's 10 year\n       probability of major osteoporotic fracture is 7.8% and 10 year\n       probability of hip fracture is 2.0%. \n        \n       According to the World Health Organization guidelines,\n       osteoporosis may be diagnosed if the lowest T-score of the lumbar\n       spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or less.  Low bone\n       density (osteopenia) may be diagnosed if the T-score falls\n       between -1.0 and -2.5.  In certain circumstances the 33% radius\n       (also called 1/3rd radius) may be utilized.  \n        \n       Osteoporosis may be diagnosed in men age 50 and older if the\n       T-score of the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or\n       less.  \n        \n       RECOMMENDATIONS: \n        \n       1.  If therapy is contemplated, mild to aggressive therapies are \n       available.  Additionally, all patients should ensure an adequate \n       intake of dietary calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (400-800 IU \n       daily).  \n        \n       2.  The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) guidelines\n       recommend initiating therapy to reduce fracture risk in\n       postmenopausal women or men over age 50 with BMD: - T-score below\n       -2.5 SD; - or T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD if the 10-year\n       probability of hip fracture is >3% or a 10-year probability of a\n       major osteoporosis-related fracture is >20% based on the\n       U.S.-adapted WHO algorithm; - or presence of a fragility\n       fracture.  \n        \n       3. Patients with diagnosed cases of osteoporosis or low bone\n       density (osteopenia) should be regularly tested for bone mineral\n       density.  For patients eligible for Medicare, routine testing is\n       allowed once every 2 years.  Testing frequency can be increased\n       for patients with rapidly progressing disease, or for those who\n       are receiving medical therapy to restore bone mass.  \n        \n       COMMENTS: \n        \n       The technical quality of the study is good.  \n \n     Primary Diagnostic Code: \n \n Primary Interpreting Staff:\n   DIANE M ICENOGLE-LEUSCHEN, MD RADIOLOGIST (Verifier)\n /DMI\n \n    \nFacility: AUDIE L.

Based\n       on the United States FRAX calculator, the patient's 10 year\n       probability of major osteoporotic fracture is 7.8% and 10 year\n       probability of hip fracture is 2.0%. \n       According to the World Health Organization guidelines,\n       osteoporosis may be diagnosed if the lowest T-score of the lumbar\n       spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or less.  Low bone\n       density (osteopenia) may be diagnosed if the T-score falls\n       between -1.0 and -2.5.  In certain circumstances the 33% radius\n       (also called 1/3rd radius) may be utilized.  \n       Osteoporosis may be diagnosed in men age 50 and older if the\n       T-score of the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or\n       less.  \n       RECOMMENDATIONS: \n       1.  If therapy is contemplated, mild to aggressive therapies are \n       available.  Additionally, all patients should ensure an adequate \n       intake of dietary calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (400-800 IU \n       daily).  \n       2.  The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) guidelines\n       recommend initiating therapy to reduce fracture risk in\n       postmenopausal women or men over age 50 with BMD: - T-score below\n       -2.5 SD; - or T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD if the 10-year\n       probability of hip fracture is >3% or a 10-year probability of a\n       major osteoporosis-related fracture is >20% based on the\n       U.S.-adapted WHO algorithm; - or presence of a fragility\n       fracture.  \n       3. Patients with diagnosed cases of osteoporosis or low bone\n       density (osteopenia) should be regularly tested for bone mineral\n       density.  For patients eligible for Medicare, routine testing is\n       allowed once every 2 years.  Testing frequency can be increased\n       for patients with rapidly progressing disease, or for those who\n       are receiving medical therapy to restore bone mass.  \n       COMMENTS: \n       The technical quality of the study is good.  \n     Primary Diagnostic Code: \n Primary Interpreting Staff:\n   DIANE M ICENOGLE-LEUSCHEN, MD RADIOLOGIST (Verifier)\n /DMI\n===============================================================================\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\nVitals: BP: 147/77, HR: 0, Temp: 96.9, O2: 20\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n\nUROLOGIC PROBLEM LIST:\nProblem List is the source for the following:\n \n  1.

Additionally, all patients should ensure an adequate \n       intake of dietary calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (400-800 IU \n       daily).  \n        \n       2.  The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) guidelines\n       recommend initiating therapy to reduce fracture risk in\n       postmenopausal women or men over age 50 with BMD: - T-score below\n       -2.5 SD; - or T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD if the 10-year\n       probability of hip fracture is >3% or a 10-year probability of a\n       major osteoporosis-related fracture is >20% based on the\n       U.S.-adapted WHO algorithm; - or presence of a fragility\n       fracture.  \n        \n       3. Patients with diagnosed cases of osteoporosis or low bone\n       density (osteopenia) should be regularly tested for bone mineral\n       density.  For patients eligible for Medicare, routine testing is\n       allowed once every 2 years.  Testing frequency can be increased\n       for patients with rapidly progressing disease, or for those who\n       are receiving medical therapy to restore bone mass.  \n        \n       COMMENTS: \n        \n       The technical quality of the study is good.  \n \n     Primary Diagnostic Code: \n \n Primary Interpreting Staff:\n   DIANE M ICENOGLE-LEUSCHEN, MD RADIOLOGIST (Verifier)\n /DMI\n \n    \nFacility: AUDIE L.

He was previously seen in our clinic on 3/17/2025 when we ordered a prostate MRI due to concerns about his PSA velocity. The MRI performed on 5/27/2025 revealed a PI-RADS 4 lesion in the right apical peripheral zone measuring 8 x 4 x 6 mm without evidence of extracapsular extension or enlarged pelvic lymph nodes. Today he presents to discuss MRI results and formulate a treatment plan. He continues to have mild lower urinary tract symptoms with nocturia being his primary complaint. For his ED, he currently uses sildenafil 100mg with limited effectiveness and is interested in exploring surgical options following his previous VED breaking. He reports recent onset of fatigue, and a recent Holter monitor from 6/24/2025 revealed first degree AV block and 3547 episodes of second degree AV block (Mobitz II), for which he has been referred to cardiology.\n\n\n+---------------+------+\n|        IPSS          |\n+---------------+------+\n| Symptom       | 6/30 |\n+---------------+------+\n| Empty         |  1   |\n| Frequency     |  3   |\n| Urgency       |  1   |\n| Hesitancy     |  0   |\n| Intermittency |  0   |\n| Flow          |  0   |\n| Nocturia      |  4   |\n+---------------+------+\n| Total         | 9/35 |\n| BI            | 2/6  |\n+---------------+------+\n\nDIETARY HISTORY: Patient reports following a low carb diet for diabetes management and minimizing salt intake for blood pressure control. He tries to limit evening fluids to manage nocturia.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Former tobacco user during military service over 20 years ago. Current alcohol use is 2-3 beers with dinner once weekly. He is employed as a safety professional. Lives with his girlfriend and plans to get married soon.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: No family history of urologic cancer. Mother had diabetes. Father had HTN and CAD with MI in his 50s and died of stroke. Brother died of diabetic complications in January 2020.\n\nSEXUAL HISTORY: Reports longstanding ED, previously treated with VED for more than 10 years until the device broke. Currently uses sildenafil 100mg with limited effectiveness. He desires more reliable erectile function and has expressed interest in an implantable penile prosthesis (IPP).\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Hammer toe - August 15, 2024\n2.

His cardiac comorbidities, specifically the newly diagnosed second-degree AV block, require cardiology clearance before any urological interventions. His other comorbidities including diabetes, cirrhosis with thrombocytopenia, and obesity increase his surgical risk and may impact treatment decisions.\n\n\nProblem #1: PI-RADS 4 lesion on prostate MRI with elevated PSA\nProblem #2: BPH with mild LUTS\nProblem #3: Medication-refractory erectile dysfunction\nProblem #4: Newly diagnosed cardiac conduction abnormalities\n\n\nPLAN:\n\n1. For PI-RADS 4 lesion with elevated PSA:\n   - Schedule MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy targeting the 8 x 4 x 6 mm lesion in the anterior right apical peripheral zone plus standard systematic sampling\n   - Will need cardiac clearance before invasive procedures given recent finding of significant conduction abnormalities\n   - Discussed risks of biopsy including bleeding, infection, urinary retention, and need for antibiotic prophylaxis\n   - Discussed risk stratification approach and potential management options depending on biopsy results\n\n2. For BPH with mild LUTS:\n   - Continue conservative management with fluid restriction in evening hours\n   - Symptoms are mild and not significantly bothersome at this time; no medications indicated\n   - Will reassess after prostate biopsy results are known, as findings may impact BPH management\n\n3. For erectile dysfunction:\n   - Defer evaluation for implantable penile prosthesis until after prostate biopsy results and cardiac workup\n   - Continue sildenafil 100mg as needed in the interim\n   - Discussed importance of optimal diabetes control for any future surgical intervention\n\n4. For cardiac issues:\n   - Defer all invasive urological procedures pending cardiology evaluation for newly diagnosed second degree AV block\n   - Contact cardiology to expedite evaluation due to potential need for urological interventions\n   - Patient to alert us when he has completed cardiology workup\n\n5. Follow-up:\n   - Call with biopsy scheduling information once cardiac clearance is obtained\n   - Return to clinic after biopsy results are available to discuss management plan\n   - Discussed possibility of cardiology recommending pacemaker placement before urological interventions\n",

We discussed the risk of alcohol and tobacco abuse and chronic \n medical diseases such as diabetes, chronic renal failure, and coronary artery \n disease and their relationship with erectile dysfunction.  A history of pelvic \n surgery and/or surgery on associated male genitourinary organs can also cause \n erectile dysfunction.  Additionally, traumatic injury to the pelvis and/or \n genitourinary organs can cause erectile dysfunction.\n \n Erectile dysfunction medications: We discussed the utilization of \n phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction such as Viagra, Cialis and \n Levitra.  I discussed with the patient the side effect profile of these \n medications. \n \n We discussed alternative treatment strategies such as vacuum erection device \n (VED), intracavernosal injections (ICI), and medicated urethral system for \n erections (MUSE). We discussed the risks and benefits of each. \n \n Finally, we discussed inflatable penile implants at great length.  We discussed \n some of the different features of these including the pump, the reservoir, and \n the cylinders.  I explained the implantation method through a penoscrotal \n incision, dilation of the corpora cavernosa, measurement of the penile size, \n selection of appropriate implant size, placement of the reservoir, and placement \n of the pump.  We discussed some of the expectations about the effectiveness of \n the device.  It should make the penis rigid upon demand, for an indefinite \n period of time. \n \n We discussed some of the risks and benefits including the risk of infection of \n an implant (1-2% requiring removal of the device and salvage antibiotic \n treatment with replacement of a new device, the latter being successful 50-85% \n of time); bleeding (small risk of scrotal hematoma and swelling); mechanical \n failure (5% at 5 years, significantly greater by 10-15 years); penile shortening \n (although we will put in as long a device as the penis can accommodate); \n adjacent organ injury (less than 1% risk of bladder or urethral injury, each of \n which generally requires termination of the implant procedure and return on \n another visit); as well as the general risks of surgery in an older man \n including risks of pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, \n venous thromboembolism, and the like. I also discussed patient and partner \n satisfaction, and I explained the satisfaction rates from clinical trials for \n patient and partner satisfaction levels are in the 90+% range.\n \n **Patient is interested in IPP, but wants to discuss with wife. Educational \n handouts provided. In the meantime, he would like to try Viagra 100 mg prn \n sexual activity. Admin instructions and side effects thoroughly discussed. He \n knows not to take it concurrently with Cialis. \n \n RTC in March as schedule with Dr. Rodriguez. RTC with me prn. If he decides \n sooner than March that he would like to proceed with IPP, he was instructed to \n call the clinic and let us know.**\n  \n /es/ ALEXANDER T.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms \n (LUTS):\n    - The patient has a history of BPH with current LUTS with moderate symptoms.\n    - The patient is currently not on any prostate medications.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED):\n    - The patient has longstanding ED, previously managed with a vacuum erection \n device (VED)+/- Oral agents.  The VED has recently broken.  Will reorder\n \n 3. PSA Monitoring:\n    - PSA levels have shown a slight increase over the years but remain within a \n range that is not immediately concerning for malignancy, considering age and \n history.\n \n 4. Renal Cystic lesion:\n    - Thought to be resolving hemorrhagic cyst.  No further imaging was \n recommended.\n \n PLAN:\n \n 1. Management of BPH and LUTS:\n    - Medications: Currently he isnt bothered enough for medical therapy.\n    - Monitoring: Follow-up with IPSS scores to assess symptom improvement or the \n need for additional interventions.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Management:\n    - VED Replacement: Since the patient prefers a VED, facilitate the \n replacement of the broken device. Educate the patient on correct usage and \n maintenance.  He is also interested in potential IPP.\n    - Pharmacotherapy: The patient is already prescribed tadalafil. Ensure \n adherence and evaluate effectiveness. Consider alternative medications or \n combination therapy if necessary.\n \n 3. PSA and Prostate Health:\n    - Continue regular PSA monitoring given the history of BPH and age-related \n risk. No immediate need for biopsy unless PSA levels rise significantly or \n symptoms suggest malignancy.\n  \n 4. Lifestyle and Supportive Care:\n    - Encourage weight management and lifestyle modifications to improve overall \n health, which might also impact LUTS and ED positively.\n    - Discuss the potential impact of alcohol on liver disease progression and \n overall health, reinforcing previous counseling.\n \n I will send to Dr. Rozanski to evaluate him for potential IPP.  The patient \n seems motivated for a possible IPP, but we did discuss his DM putting him at \n risk for potential complications such as postop infection.\n \n RTC 6 months to confirm a more recent PSA measurement, and also to followup on \n his progress with the VED or IPP.\n \n Time of Start:10:50 AM\n Time End: 11:30 AM\n Time Spent in Chart prep, review, interpretation, & documentation: See Below\n Total Time Spent:40 minutes\n \n  \n /es/ RONALD RODRIGUEZ\n MD/Urology\n Signed: 09/16/2024 11:29\nFacility: AUDIE L.

We discussed the risk of alcohol and tobacco abuse and chronic \n medical diseases such as diabetes, chronic renal failure, and coronary artery \n disease and their relationship with erectile dysfunction.  A history of pelvic \n surgery and/or surgery on associated male genitourinary organs can also cause \n erectile dysfunction.  Additionally, traumatic injury to the pelvis and/or \n genitourinary organs can cause erectile dysfunction.\n \n Erectile dysfunction medications: We discussed the utilization of \n phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction such as Viagra, Cialis and \n Levitra.  I discussed with the patient the side effect profile of these \n medications. \n \n We discussed alternative treatment strategies such as vacuum erection device \n (VED), intracavernosal injections (ICI), and medicated urethral system for \n erections (MUSE). We discussed the risks and benefits of each. \n \n Finally, we discussed inflatable penile implants at great length.  We discussed \n some of the different features of these including the pump, the reservoir, and \n the cylinders.  I explained the implantation method through a penoscrotal \n incision, dilation of the corpora cavernosa, measurement of the penile size, \n selection of appropriate implant size, placement of the reservoir, and placement \n of the pump.  We discussed some of the expectations about the effectiveness of \n the device.  It should make the penis rigid upon demand, for an indefinite \n period of time. \n \n We discussed some of the risks and benefits including the risk of infection of \n an implant (1-2% requiring removal of the device and salvage antibiotic \n treatment with replacement of a new device, the latter being successful 50-85% \n of time); bleeding (small risk of scrotal hematoma and swelling); mechanical \n failure (5% at 5 years, significantly greater by 10-15 years); penile shortening \n (although we will put in as long a device as the penis can accommodate); \n adjacent organ injury (less than 1% risk of bladder or urethral injury, each of \n which generally requires termination of the implant procedure and return on \n another visit); as well as the general risks of surgery in an older man \n including risks of pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, \n venous thromboembolism, and the like. I also discussed patient and partner \n satisfaction, and I explained the satisfaction rates from clinical trials for \n patient and partner satisfaction levels are in the 90+% range.\n \n **Patient is interested in IPP, but wants to discuss with wife. Educational \n handouts provided. In the meantime, he would like to try Viagra 100 mg prn \n sexual activity. Admin instructions and side effects thoroughly discussed. He \n knows not to take it concurrently with Cialis. \n \n RTC in March as schedule with Dr. Rodriguez. RTC with me prn. If he decides \n sooner than March that he would like to proceed with IPP, he was instructed to \n call the clinic and let us know.**\n  \n /es/ ALEXANDER T.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms \n (LUTS):\n    - The patient has a history of BPH with current LUTS with moderate symptoms.\n    - The patient is currently not on any prostate medications.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED):\n    - The patient has longstanding ED, previously managed with a vacuum erection \n device (VED)+/- Oral agents.  The VED has recently broken.  Will reorder\n \n 3. PSA Monitoring:\n    - PSA levels have shown a slight increase over the years but remain within a \n range that is not immediately concerning for malignancy, considering age and \n history.\n \n 4. Renal Cystic lesion:\n    - Thought to be resolving hemorrhagic cyst.  No further imaging was \n recommended.\n \n PLAN:\n \n 1. Management of BPH and LUTS:\n    - Medications: Currently he isnt bothered enough for medical therapy.\n    - Monitoring: Follow-up with IPSS scores to assess symptom improvement or the \n need for additional interventions.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Management:\n    - VED Replacement: Since the patient prefers a VED, facilitate the \n replacement of the broken device. Educate the patient on correct usage and \n maintenance.  He is also interested in potential IPP.\n    - Pharmacotherapy: The patient is already prescribed tadalafil. Ensure \n adherence and evaluate effectiveness. Consider alternative medications or \n combination therapy if necessary.\n \n 3. PSA and Prostate Health:\n    - Continue regular PSA monitoring given the history of BPH and age-related \n risk. No immediate need for biopsy unless PSA levels rise significantly or \n symptoms suggest malignancy.\n  \n 4. Lifestyle and Supportive Care:\n    - Encourage weight management and lifestyle modifications to improve overall \n health, which might also impact LUTS and ED positively.\n    - Discuss the potential impact of alcohol on liver disease progression and \n overall health, reinforcing previous counseling.\n \n I will send to Dr. Rozanski to evaluate him for potential IPP.  The patient \n seems motivated for a possible IPP, but we did discuss his DM putting him at \n risk for potential complications such as postop infection.\n \n RTC 6 months to confirm a more recent PSA measurement, and also to followup on \n his progress with the VED or IPP.\n \n Time of Start:10:50 AM\n Time End: 11:30 AM\n Time Spent in Chart prep, review, interpretation, & documentation: See Below\n Total Time Spent:40 minutes\n \n  \n /es/ RONALD RODRIGUEZ\n MD/Urology\n Signed: 09/16/2024 11:29\nFacility: AUDIE L.

We discussed the risk of alcohol and tobacco abuse and chronic \n medical diseases such as diabetes, chronic renal failure, and coronary artery \n disease and their relationship with erectile dysfunction.  A history of pelvic \n surgery and/or surgery on associated male genitourinary organs can also cause \n erectile dysfunction.  Additionally, traumatic injury to the pelvis and/or \n genitourinary organs can cause erectile dysfunction.\n \n Erectile dysfunction medications: We discussed the utilization of \n phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction such as Viagra, Cialis and \n Levitra.  I discussed with the patient the side effect profile of these \n medications. \n \n We discussed alternative treatment strategies such as vacuum erection device \n (VED), intracavernosal injections (ICI), and medicated urethral system for \n erections (MUSE). We discussed the risks and benefits of each. \n \n Finally, we discussed inflatable penile implants at great length.  We discussed \n some of the different features of these including the pump, the reservoir, and \n the cylinders.  I explained the implantation method through a penoscrotal \n incision, dilation of the corpora cavernosa, measurement of the penile size, \n selection of appropriate implant size, placement of the reservoir, and placement \n of the pump.  We discussed some of the expectations about the effectiveness of \n the device.  It should make the penis rigid upon demand, for an indefinite \n period of time. \n \n We discussed some of the risks and benefits including the risk of infection of \n an implant (1-2% requiring removal of the device and salvage antibiotic \n treatment with replacement of a new device, the latter being successful 50-85% \n of time); bleeding (small risk of scrotal hematoma and swelling); mechanical \n failure (5% at 5 years, significantly greater by 10-15 years); penile shortening \n (although we will put in as long a device as the penis can accommodate); \n adjacent organ injury (less than 1% risk of bladder or urethral injury, each of \n which generally requires termination of the implant procedure and return on \n another visit); as well as the general risks of surgery in an older man \n including risks of pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, \n venous thromboembolism, and the like. I also discussed patient and partner \n satisfaction, and I explained the satisfaction rates from clinical trials for \n patient and partner satisfaction levels are in the 90+% range.\n \n **Patient is interested in IPP, but wants to discuss with wife. Educational \n handouts provided. In the meantime, he would like to try Viagra 100 mg prn \n sexual activity. Admin instructions and side effects thoroughly discussed. He \n knows not to take it concurrently with Cialis. \n \n RTC in March as schedule with Dr. Rodriguez. RTC with me prn.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms \n (LUTS):\n    - The patient has a history of BPH with current LUTS with moderate symptoms.\n    - The patient is currently not on any prostate medications.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED):\n    - The patient has longstanding ED, previously managed with a vacuum erection \n device (VED)+/- Oral agents.  The VED has recently broken.  Will reorder\n \n 3. PSA Monitoring:\n    - PSA levels have shown a slight increase over the years but remain within a \n range that is not immediately concerning for malignancy, considering age and \n history.\n \n 4. Renal Cystic lesion:\n    - Thought to be resolving hemorrhagic cyst.  No further imaging was \n recommended.\n \n PLAN:\n \n 1. Management of BPH and LUTS:\n    - Medications: Currently he isnt bothered enough for medical therapy.\n    - Monitoring: Follow-up with IPSS scores to assess symptom improvement or the \n need for additional interventions.\n \n 2. Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Management:\n    - VED Replacement: Since the patient prefers a VED, facilitate the \n replacement of the broken device. Educate the patient on correct usage and \n maintenance.  He is also interested in potential IPP.\n    - Pharmacotherapy: The patient is already prescribed tadalafil. Ensure \n adherence and evaluate effectiveness. Consider alternative medications or \n combination therapy if necessary.\n \n 3. PSA and Prostate Health:\n    - Continue regular PSA monitoring given the history of BPH and age-related \n risk. No immediate need for biopsy unless PSA levels rise significantly or \n symptoms suggest malignancy.\n  \n 4. Lifestyle and Supportive Care:\n    - Encourage weight management and lifestyle modifications to improve overall \n health, which might also impact LUTS and ED positively.\n    - Discuss the potential impact of alcohol on liver disease progression and \n overall health, reinforcing previous counseling.\n \n I will send to Dr. Rozanski to evaluate him for potential IPP.  The patient \n seems motivated for a possible IPP, but we did discuss his DM putting him at \n risk for potential complications such as postop infection.\n \n RTC 6 months to confirm a more recent PSA measurement, and also to followup on \n his progress with the VED or IPP.\n \n Time of Start:10:50 AM\n Time End: 11:30 AM\n Time Spent in Chart prep, review, interpretation, & documentation: See Below\n Total Time Spent:40 minutes\n \n  \n /es/ RONALD RODRIGUEZ\n MD/Urology\n Signed: 09/16/2024 11:29\nFacility: AUDIE L.

He has a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis with metabolic abnormalities. His primary hyperparathyroidism was addressed surgically in February 2025 with a right hemithyroidectomy and removal of parathyroid adenoma, which incidentally found a 4.5mm papillary thyroid carcinoma (T1a with negative margins). Recent CT scan from June 2025 showed no urolithiasis, representing improvement from previous imaging. He also has a history of stable Bosniak II cyst in the left kidney.\n\nThe patient continues to have erectile dysfunction but is not currently seeking treatment as he reports he doesn't have sex currently. He also reports mild BPH symptoms with an IPSS score of 2/35 and bother index of 1/6. He is currently managed on prazosin 5mg daily (originally prescribed for PTSD nightmares).\n\nHe recently had severe hypoglycemia in May 2025 with a glucose level of 46 mg/dL, and has had multiple episodes of AM hypoglycemia. He is wearing a CGM for glucose monitoring.\n\n+---------------+------+\n|        IPSS          |\n+---------------+------+\n| Symptom       | 6/30 |\n+---------------+------+\n| Empty         |  0   |\n| Frequency     |  0   |\n| Urgency       |  0   |\n| Hesitancy     |  1   |\n| Intermittency |  0   |\n| Flow          |  1   |\n| Nocturia      |  0   |\n+---------------+------+\n| Total         | 2/35 |\n| BI            | 1/6  |\n+---------------+------+\n\n DIETARY HISTORY:\nNo coffee consumption.

His most recent CT scan now shows no evidence of kidney stones, suggesting his treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism has successfully addressed his stone disease. His mild BPH symptoms are well-controlled on prazosin, which was initially prescribed for his PTSD. His erectile dysfunction is currently not being treated as he reports no interest in sexual activity at this time. He has multiple medical comorbidities that are being managed by other providers, including poorly controlled diabetes with hypoglycemic episodes, and is going through personal challenges with a divorce.\n\n Problem #1:\nNephrolithiasis - Previously had metabolic abnormalities including hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, and hyperuricosuria. Status post parathyroidectomy with resolution of kidney stones on recent imaging, suggesting successful treatment of the underlying hyperparathyroidism.\n\n Problem #2:\nRenal Cysts - Stable Bosniak II cyst in the left kidney, unchanged on recent imaging and requiring continued surveillance but no intervention.\n\n Problem #3:\nErectile Dysfunction - Longstanding issue currently not requiring treatment per patient preference. Likely multifactorial etiology including age, diabetes, medications (particularly spironolactone which has antiandrogen effects), and psychological factors.\n\n PLAN:\n\n1. Nephrolithiasis Management:\n   - Continue current dietary modifications with focus on:\n     - Maintaining high fluid intake (>2.5 L/day)\n     - Low sodium diet (<2000 mg/day)\n     - Limited oxalate intake\n     - Adequate dietary calcium with meals\n   - No kidney stones present on current imaging, indicating resolution after parathyroidectomy\n   - Repeat 24-hour urine collection in 3 months to assess metabolic parameters post-parathyroidectomy\n   - Follow-up CT scan in 12 months to ensure continued absence of stones\n\n2. Renal Cyst Management:\n   - Continue surveillance with annual imaging (alternating ultrasound and CT)\n   - No specific intervention required as the Bosniak II cyst has been stable\n\n3. Erectile Dysfunction:\n   - Currently deferred per patient preference as he is not sexually active\n   - Discussed potential contribution of spironolactone (antiandrogen effects) to ED and recommended discussion with PCP about potentially changing this medication\n   - Will revisit treatment options if patient's interest changes\n   - Note that any PDE5 inhibitor treatment would require caution given his cardiac medications and history of atrial fibrillation\n\n4. Mild BPH:\n   - Continue current management with prazosin 5mg nightly\n   - IPSS score remains low at 2/35 with minimal bother (1/6)\n   - No need for additional BPH medications at this time\n\n5. Follow-up:\n   - Return to clinic in 3 months with 24-hour urine collection prior to visit\n   - Encourage follow-up with endocrinology for diabetes management given recent hypoglycemic episodes\n   - Recommend sleep study follow-up as previously ordered by endocrinology\n\nPatient was counseled on the importance of continuing dietary modifications for stone prevention and diabetic management. He verbalized understanding of the plan and agreed to complete the follow-up testing prior to next appointment.\n",
    "actual_output": "CC: Right Renal Mass\n\nHPI:\nThe patient is a 79 year old MALE with history of a greenlight laser ~ 9 \nyears ago with significant prostate tissue and tight BN noted on cysto Oct '22. \nWhile he did have regrowth, he did not proceed to surgery as he had significant \nrisk factors and has been managed medically.  He is on Flomax twice daily.  More \nrecently, a small renal mass has been noted.  I reviewed the imaging.  There was \nsome inconsistency in the reports as to regards of the side of the lesion, and \nalso absence of the lesion on some studies (US).  Ultimately, I was able to find \nthe lesion on the right in the MRIs performed, and it seems to be small. \nBecause of his medical comorbidities, this mass has been followed on active \nsurveillance.

Penicillin allergic reaction, remote hx, 60 yrs ago. \n -Today's skin test and oral challenge are NEGATIVE. \n -Will remove this allergy from postings. \n -Pt is free to use beta-lactam abx when needed. \n \n 2. Iron dextran post-reaction tryptase level is higher than expected. \n -Pt's tryptase level, though done 2 days after the initial reaction \n is higher than expected for a serum baseline tryptase, and suggests a mast cell \n mediated event. \n -Pt did not obtain repeat tryptase level on 9/6/24. \n -*It is now advised that serum baseline tyrptase levels >8.0 be investigated for \n underlying mast cell disease. Will repeat SB tryptase level and if it remains \n above 8.0, will initiate an eval for underlying MC ds.\n \n 3. Iron dextran anaphylaxis (occured 8/13/24).\n -Pt hx is most consistent with this diagnosis. This initial event m/l lead \n 2ndarily to the cardiogenic shock. \n -After a brief review of the literature, there are documented iron \n desensitization protocols available. \n ***However, the pt voiced significant concern about ever receiving an iron \n infusion again and would like to consider blood tranfusions to manage his \n anemia, in the future instead, if needed. Advised pt to discuss this further \n with his nephrologist and hepatologist. \n \n 4.

He was diagnosed in September 2024 with GG4 cT2b high-risk prostate cancer. Following his diagnosis, he opted for radiation therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). He received his first Eligard (leuprolide) 45mg injection in December 2024 and completed his radiation treatments in March 2025, receiving 60 Gy in 20 fractions. His most recent PSA on 6/3/2025 is 0.01, demonstrating excellent response to treatment. However, he continues to struggle with significant side effects from the ADT, including severe irritability, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and worsening of his underlying PTSD. He also reports rectal urgency and diarrhea following radiation therapy. He had bilateral conjunctivitis treated in the ER on 6/20/2025 with complete resolution. He has no hematuria or new bone pain. Recent testosterone level shows continued castrate levels (<10). The patient is now due for his second Eligard injection, but given his significant side effects, we will need to discuss whether to continue with ADT. He also recently visited the ER on 4/28/25 for fever and bodyaches which was diagnosed as a viral syndrome.\n\n+---------------+------+\n|        IPSS          |\n+---------------+------+\n| Date          |6/30/25|\n+---------------+------+\n| Empty         |  2   |\n| Frequency     |  3   |\n| Urgency       |  2   |\n| Hesitancy     |  1   |\n| Intermittency |  1   |\n| Flow          |  1   |\n| Nocturia      |  1   |\n+---------------+------+\n| Total         |11/35 |\n| BI            | 3/6  |\n+---------------+------+\n\nDIETARY HISTORY: Coffee- 20-30 oz daily (about 8 cups worth).

No PSMA PET avid sites of metastatic disease.\n\nMRI Prostate (7/25/2024): Lesion in the anterior right mid gland stable since 2021 (PI-RADS 2). No new prostate lesion, evidence of extracapsular extension, or pelvic adenopathy.\n\nCT Chest (4/17/2025): Redemonstrated cavitation with wall thickening in right lower lobe, mildly more conspicuous than seen on prior exam. Other area of cavitation and parenchymal calcification in right lower lobe is similar.

He is responding very well to treatment with PSA now undetectable (0.01). He continues to have significant ADT side effects including depression, irritability, fatigue, and worsening of his underlying PTSD. Given his excellent response to therapy and significant quality of life impact from ADT, discontinuation of hormone therapy is reasonable at this time, especially since he has already received nearly 7 months of treatment. He also has a history of liver cirrhosis with stable liver function, diabetes with adequate control, and a pulmonary nodule that appears stable, though with slightly increased wall thickening requiring continued surveillance.\n\nProblem #1: Prostate cancer, high risk (GG4, cT2b) - excellent response to radiation therapy and ADT.\nProblem #2: ADT side effects - severe enough to discontinue therapy at this time.\nProblem #3: Type 2 DM - HbA1c 6.4%, continue current management.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Discontinue ADT at this time given significant side effects and excellent PSA response.\n2. Continue calcium/vitamin D supplementation to support bone health.\n3. Follow PSA every 3 months; if PSA begins to rise significantly, will reconsider ADT options.\n4. Continue pulmonary nodule monitoring with follow-up CT chest in 6 months.\n5. Refill all current medications including tadalafil for ED.\n6. Follow up in urology clinic in 3 months with pre-visit PSA and testosterone.\n7. Consider psychiatric consultation for management of depression and PTSD if symptoms don't improve after ADT discontinuation.\n8. Continue to monitor liver status with regular labs, next set in 3 months.\n\nEND DIALOGUE\n",

He has a history of left spermatocele/hydrocele for which he underwent surgery on 6/10/2022 with an unremarkable postoperative course. He was noted to have a urinary tract infection with ascending infection to the right upper tract in July 2023, at which time his PSA was elevated at 4.28 ng/mL. Since then, his PSA has normalized with values of 1.84 ng/mL (10/2023), 1.30 ng/mL (7/2024), and most recently 1.00 ng/mL (6/2025). Recent CT abdomen/pelvis from 3/6/2025 showed no lymphadenopathy, confirming resolution of previously seen retroperitoneal lymph nodes that were likely inflammatory in nature.\n\nHe denies any current difficulties with urination. Stream is medium-strong in intensity. He denies intermittency, straining, hesitancy, sensation of incomplete emptying, hematuria, dysuria, frequency, or interval UTIs since he was last seen. He occasionally wakes once nightly to urinate.\n\n+---------------+------+\n|        IPSS          |\n+---------------+------+\n| Symptom       | 6/30 |\n+---------------+------+\n| Empty         |  0   |\n| Frequency     |  1   |\n| Urgency       |  0   |\n| Hesitancy     |  0   |\n| Intermittency |  0   |\n| Flow          |  0   |\n| Nocturia      |  1   |\n+---------------+------+\n| Total         | 2/35 |\n| BI            | 1/6  |\n+---------------+------+\n\nDIETARY HISTORY: Working on eating healthier and has lost some weight.

Bilateral renal cysts. Small bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias. Small fat-containing umbilical hernia. Degenerative changes in the spine.\n\nCT urogram (1/9/2024): 3.4 cm simple left renal cyst (Bosniak category 1). Additional subcentimeter hypodense lesions in both kidneys.

He had a history of acute pyelonephritis with transient PSA elevation in July 2023, which has since normalized with his most recent PSA at 1.00 ng/mL. Previous retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy has resolved, confirming the inflammatory etiology. His current urinary symptoms are minimal with an IPSS score of only 2/35, and he reports good erectile function with sildenafil when needed. Recent CT showed stable renal cysts with no concerning lesions.\n\n\nProblem #1: History of elevated PSA - Given the normalization of PSA and the absence of lymphadenopathy on recent imaging, the transient elevation appears to have been inflammatory in nature secondary to his urinary tract infection in 2023. Will continue monitoring with regular PSA checks.\n\nProblem #2: Mild LUTS - The patient reports minimal urinary symptoms with an IPSS score of 2/35. No medication needed at this time given the minimal symptomatology.\n\nProblem #3: Erectile dysfunction - Continue sildenafil 50mg as needed.\n\nProblem #4: History of atrial fibrillation - Diagnosed in August 2024, currently on metoprolol and apixaban for rate control and anticoagulation. Continue current management and follow with cardiology.\n\n\nPLAN:\n1. Continue monitoring PSA levels: repeat PSA in 6 months\n2. No pharmacological intervention needed for minimal LUTS at this time\n3. Continue sildenafil 50mg PRN for ED\n4. Follow up with urology in 6 months with PSA and urinalysis\n5. Follow up with cardiology regarding atrial fibrillation management\n6. Continue current medications including apixaban for atrial fibrillation\n7. Encourage continued weight loss efforts and healthy lifestyle changes to help with both urologic and cardiac health\n",

Right testicle \n        measures 4.9 x 2.7 x 3.2 cm. No intratesticular masses or cysts. \n        Symmetric testicular flow. \n  \n        Right epididymal head cysts/spermatoceles measuring up to 5 mm. \n        Left epididymal head cyst/spermatocele measuring 6 mm. \n  \n        In the region of the left epididymal body/tail, there is a large \n        7.9 x 3.6 x 6.7 cm anechoic simple cystic structure (previously 4 \n        x 5.7 x 6.0 cm). Again this displaces the left testicle midline. \n  \n        Possible small right varicocele is present. \n  \n  \n  \n      Impression:\n \n \n        Enlarging left hemiscrotal simple cystic structure that is likely \n        a spermatocele but could be a loculated hydrocele.\n \n ================================================================================\n \n Copied from JLV: CT Urogram 1/9/24 Baptist MS Imaging\n Findings:\n GU System:\n Kidneys: The kidneys are normal in size and shape.  A 3.4 cm simple left renal \n cyst is seen (Bosniak category 1).  No further imaging follow-up of this cyst is \n required.  Additional subcentimeter hypodense lesions are seen in both kidneys, \n which may represent cysts, however are too small to further characterize on this \n examination.  The distal aspect of the bilateral ureters is not well opacified \n with contrast.  Otherwise the remaining segments of the ureters are well \n opacified without focal filling defect or evidence of obstruction.  No calculus \n is identified within the collecting systems.\n Adrenal glands: The adrenal glands are normal without focal lesion evident.\n Bladder/pelvis: The bladder is unremarkable without filling defects evident.\n \n Impression:\n No acute abnormality within the abdomen or pelvis, specifically no urinary tract \n calculus or collecting system obstruction\n \n ASSESSMENT:\n GU Problems Identified:\n \n -Elevated PSA-  PSA previously appeared ot have elevated at last visit, has now \n declined and WNL for age, DRE at last visit without suspicious features and \n noted to have lack of an obvious lesion on prostate MRI.  will continue to \n monitor. \n \n -Radiographic evidence of cystitis and pyelonephritis- Per previous note \"Lymph \n node disease was identified in the imaging, though thought to be most likely \n reactive.  Metastatic disease is not excluded.  CTU completed 1/9/24 completed \n with Baptist MS imaging did not note any pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, \n likely reactive.\n \n -ED- Continue sildenafil 50 mg prn\n \n PLAN/RECOMMENDATIONS:\n RTC ALM GU Staff 8 flwp in 6 months with PSA, UA, c&s\n  \n /es/ MADELEINE ROSE BARTRUG\n PA-C\n Signed: 02/03/2024 18:04\nFacility: AUDIE L.

Correlate with urinalysis. \n  \n \n \n 7/29/23 MRI ABDOMEN PELVIS WOW CONTRAST\n Impression:\n  \n  \n        -No intra-abdominal abscess is visualized. \n  \n        -Redemonstrated moderate bladder wall thickening concerning for \n        cystitis. \n  \n        -Mild inflammation surrounds the right kidney and right ureter, \n        possible ascending urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis. No \n        renal abscess is visualized. \n  \n        -Subcentimeter but prominent right lower periureteral lymph \n        nodes, better demonstrated on the prior CT. Reactive or \n        metastatic etiology is possible. \n  \n        -Ancillary findings, above. \n  \n \n \n scrotal ultrasound 4/1/2022\n FINDINGS: \n  \n        The left testicle measures 4.2 x 2.3 x 3.6 cm. Right testicle \n        measures 4.9 x 2.7 x 3.2 cm. No intratesticular masses or cysts. \n        Symmetric testicular flow. \n  \n        Right epididymal head cysts/spermatoceles measuring up to 5 mm. \n        Left epididymal head cyst/spermatocele measuring 6 mm. \n  \n        In the region of the left epididymal body/tail, there is a large \n        7.9 x 3.6 x 6.7 cm anechoic simple cystic structure (previously 4 \n        x 5.7 x 6.0 cm). Again this displaces the left testicle midline. \n  \n        Possible small right varicocele is present. \n  \n  \n  \n      Impression:\n \n \n        Enlarging left hemiscrotal simple cystic structure that is likely \n        a spermatocele but could be a loculated hydrocele.\n \n ================================================================\n GENERAL ROS:\n Gen: Independent ADL's , No fever, chills, wt loss\n EENT:  No recent visual changes, no stiff neck or limited range of motion\n Derm: No abnormal or changing skin lesions. \n CV:  No chest pain at rest; No palpitations, No syncope, No \n claudication, No PND;  No easy bleeding or bruising\n RESP:  No report of dyspnea or SOB at rest\n GI:  No diarrhea, nausea, vomiting \n GU: See HPI\n MSK: no myalgias or new bone pain \n Neuro: No headache, syncope, dizziness.\n Psych: No depression or anxiety. \n  \n \n PHYSICAL EXAM:\n \n \n GENERAL: well developed, well nourished, gentleman with appropriate \n orientation, mood, affect, demeanor and dress.\n HEENT: normal symmetric, non-tender neck without mass/thyromegaly to \n palpation\n CHEST: normal respiratory effort; no gynecomastia or masses.\n ABDOMEN: soft, non-tender, non-distended, without masses or organomegally. \n No palpable hernias.\n GU: no CVAT, or bladder tenderness/ fullness.\n RECTAL: Normal anus and perineum; intact sphincter tone; no hemorrhoids or \n rectal masses.\n PROSTATE: \n CNS: grossly intact motor function and sensation.\n \n \n \n ASSESSMENT: 65-year-old Latin American male with h/o multiple sclerosis, on oral \n and injection therapy, and evidence of a recent urinary tract infection with \n ascending infection to the right side upper tracts.  At the same time the PSA \n became acutely elevated.\n \n \n Problem #1: Elevated PSA.  Given the lack of an obvious lesion on the MRI of the \n prostate, and evidence of a recent urinary infection at the time the PSA was \n drawn?this appears to be purely inflammatory.  We will repeat PSA in 6 months.\n \n Problem #2: Radiographic evidence of cystitis and pyelonephritis.  Lymph node \n disease was identified in the imaging, though thought to be most likely \n reactive.  Metastatic disease is not excluded.  Recommend repeat imaging as \n follow-up to ensure this is resolved\n \n Problem #3: BPH with lower urinary tract symptoms.  Previously not treated.  May \n have contributed to this urinary infection\n \n Problem #4: Erectile dysfunction.  Continue with sildenafil 50 mg as needed.\n \n PLAN:\n \n Repeat labs with CBC, UA, urine culture, BMP now that the acute infection has \n passed.  CT urogram as follow-up to ensure that the bladder, and upper tracts \n inflammatory processes have resolved\n \n If the UA shows evidence of persistent hematuria, will complete that work-up \n with cystoscopy\n If not, we will make recommendations based on findings.\n \n Return to clinic in 2 to 3 months\n \n \n \n Time of Start:14:00\n Time End: 14:20\n Time Spent in Chart prep, review, interpretation, & documentation: See Below\n Total Time Spent:40\n \n \n \n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n |                  Time Breakdown                   | Mins |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Chart Prep:                                       |   5  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Image Review:                                     |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Lab Review:                                       |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Notes:                                            |   5  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Obtaining/Reviewing separately obtained history:  |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Medical/PE:                                       |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Counseling, Educating patient, family, caregiver: |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Ordering:                                         |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Referring or Communicating with other providers:  |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Documentation clinical information in HER:        |  10  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Independent interpretation:                       |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Care Coordination:                                |   3  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n |                                                   |      |\n | Total:                                            |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n \n \n Please note that I have spent >40 total minutes in this visit, with >20 minutes \n in counseling and coordination of care including chart review, lab \n interpretation, discussion of findings with the patient, independent \n interpretation of data, communicating or referring to providers, formation of a \n treatment plan with shared decision making , placing orders, coordinating \n follow-up and documenting the encounter. \n  \n /es/ RONALD RODRIGUEZ\n MD/Urology\n Signed: 10/02/2023 14:26\nFacility: AUDIE L.

Reactive or \n        metastatic etiology is possible. \n  \n        -Ancillary findings, above. \n  \n \n \n scrotal ultrasound 4/1/2022\n FINDINGS: \n  \n        The left testicle measures 4.2 x 2.3 x 3.6 cm. Right testicle \n        measures 4.9 x 2.7 x 3.2 cm. No intratesticular masses or cysts. \n        Symmetric testicular flow. \n  \n        Right epididymal head cysts/spermatoceles measuring up to 5 mm. \n        Left epididymal head cyst/spermatocele measuring 6 mm. \n  \n        In the region of the left epididymal body/tail, there is a large \n        7.9 x 3.6 x 6.7 cm anechoic simple cystic structure (previously 4 \n        x 5.7 x 6.0 cm). Again this displaces the left testicle midline. \n  \n        Possible small right varicocele is present. \n  \n  \n  \n      Impression:\n \n \n        Enlarging left hemiscrotal simple cystic structure that is likely \n        a spermatocele but could be a loculated hydrocele.\n \n ================================================================\n GENERAL ROS:\n Gen: Independent ADL's , No fever, chills, wt loss\n EENT:  No recent visual changes, no stiff neck or limited range of motion\n Derm: No abnormal or changing skin lesions. \n CV:  No chest pain at rest; No palpitations, No syncope, No \n claudication, No PND;  No easy bleeding or bruising\n RESP:  No report of dyspnea or SOB at rest\n GI:  No diarrhea, nausea, vomiting \n GU: See HPI\n MSK: no myalgias or new bone pain \n Neuro: No headache, syncope, dizziness.\n Psych: No depression or anxiety. \n  \n \n PHYSICAL EXAM:\n \n \n GENERAL: well developed, well nourished, gentleman with appropriate \n orientation, mood, affect, demeanor and dress.\n HEENT: normal symmetric, non-tender neck without mass/thyromegaly to \n palpation\n CHEST: normal respiratory effort; no gynecomastia or masses.\n ABDOMEN: soft, non-tender, non-distended, without masses or organomegally. \n No palpable hernias.\n GU: no CVAT, or bladder tenderness/ fullness.\n RECTAL: Normal anus and perineum; intact sphincter tone; no hemorrhoids or \n rectal masses.\n PROSTATE: \n CNS: grossly intact motor function and sensation.\n \n \n \n ASSESSMENT: 65-year-old Latin American male with h/o multiple sclerosis, on oral \n and injection therapy, and evidence of a recent urinary tract infection with \n ascending infection to the right side upper tracts.  At the same time the PSA \n became acutely elevated.\n \n \n Problem #1: Elevated PSA.  Given the lack of an obvious lesion on the MRI of the \n prostate, and evidence of a recent urinary infection at the time the PSA was \n drawn?this appears to be purely inflammatory.  We will repeat PSA in 6 months.\n \n Problem #2: Radiographic evidence of cystitis and pyelonephritis.  Lymph node \n disease was identified in the imaging, though thought to be most likely \n reactive.  Metastatic disease is not excluded.  Recommend repeat imaging as \n follow-up to ensure this is resolved\n \n Problem #3: BPH with lower urinary tract symptoms.  Previously not treated.  May \n have contributed to this urinary infection\n \n Problem #4: Erectile dysfunction.  Continue with sildenafil 50 mg as needed.\n \n PLAN:\n \n Repeat labs with CBC, UA, urine culture, BMP now that the acute infection has \n passed.  CT urogram as follow-up to ensure that the bladder, and upper tracts \n inflammatory processes have resolved\n \n If the UA shows evidence of persistent hematuria, will complete that work-up \n with cystoscopy\n If not, we will make recommendations based on findings.\n \n Return to clinic in 2 to 3 months\n \n \n \n Time of Start:14:00\n Time End: 14:20\n Time Spent in Chart prep, review, interpretation, & documentation: See Below\n Total Time Spent:40\n \n \n \n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n |                  Time Breakdown                   | Mins |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Chart Prep:                                       |   5  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Image Review:                                     |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Lab Review:                                       |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Notes:                                            |   5  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Obtaining/Reviewing separately obtained history:  |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Medical/PE:                                       |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Counseling, Educating patient, family, caregiver: |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Ordering:                                         |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Referring or Communicating with other providers:  |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Documentation clinical information in HER:        |  10  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Independent interpretation:                       |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n | Care Coordination:                                |   3  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n |                                                   |      |\n | Total:                                            |   X  |\n +---------------------------------------------------+------+\n \n \n Please note that I have spent >40 total minutes in this visit, with >20 minutes \n in counseling and coordination of care including chart review, lab \n interpretation, discussion of findings with the patient, independent \n interpretation of data, communicating or referring to providers, formation of a \n treatment plan with shared decision making , placing orders, coordinating \n follow-up and documenting the encounter. \n  \n /es/ RONALD RODRIGUEZ\n MD/Urology\n Signed: 10/02/2023 14:26\nFacility: AUDIE L.

He was last seen in the Urology clinic on January 6, 2025, at which time his PSA had increased to 5.18 ng/mL (January 2025) from 3.74 ng/mL (March 2024). His PSA values have fluctuated in the past, with a peak of 6.32 ng/mL in February 2024, which later decreased. An MRI of the prostate performed in May 2024 was negative for suspicious lesions (PI-RADS 2). \n\nThe patient has a history of male hypogonadism with laboratory findings from January 2025 showing total testosterone of 420 ng/dL but a low free testosterone of 50 pg/mL. His endocrine evaluation showed FSH 2.7 mIU/mL and LH 2.2 mIU/mL, both within normal limits.\n\nHe continues to report erectile dysfunction, which is managed with sildenafil 100mg as needed, though he experiences headaches as a side effect. He reports he takes it on an empty stomach, which helps with effectiveness but still causes headaches.\n\nSince his last visit, the patient has recovered from a proximal humerus fracture that occurred while roller skating. He has no new urologic symptoms and reports minimal lower urinary tract symptoms.\n\n+---------------+------+--------+--------+\n|                 IPSS                    |\n+---------------+------+--------+--------+\n| Symptom        4/1/24| 7/15/24| 6/30/25|\n+---------------+------+--------+--------+\n| Empty         |  0   |    0   |    0   |\n| Frequency     |  2   |    2   |    1   |\n| Urgency       |  0   |    1   |    1   |\n| Hesitancy     |  0   |    0   |    0   |\n| Intermittency |  0   |    0   |    0   |\n| Flow          |  0   |    0   |    0   |\n| Nocturia      |  1   |    2   |    2   |\n+---------------+------+--------+--------+\n| Total         | 3/35 |  5/35  |  4/35  |\n| BI            | 1/6  |   1/6  |   1/6  |\n+---------------+------+--------+--------+\n\n DIETARY HISTORY:\nPatient continues to drink caffeinated soda in the morning rather than coffee, which contributes to some urinary frequency.

Despite this elevation, his prostate MRI from May 2024 was negative for suspicious lesions (PI-RADS 2). He has laboratory-confirmed hypogonadism with low free testosterone despite borderline-normal total testosterone, suggesting possible SHBG abnormality. His endocrine workup with normal LH and FSH suggests secondary hypogonadism. His lower urinary tract symptoms remain mild with IPSS of 4/35. His erectile dysfunction is adequately managed with sildenafil despite the side effect of headaches.\n\n Problem #1: Elevated PSA (5.18 ng/mL)\n- PSA has fluctuated over time, with recent increase from 3.74 to 5.18 ng/mL\n- MRI prostate in May 2024 was negative for suspicious lesions\n- Digital rectal examination today is negative for nodules or induration\n\n Problem #2: Secondary Hypogonadism\n- Total testosterone 420 ng/dL (normal), but free testosterone 50 pg/mL (low)\n- Normal LH/FSH levels suggest pituitary/hypothalamic etiology\n- Patient reports fatigue and sexual dysfunction consistent with hypogonadism\n\n Problem #3: Erectile Dysfunction\n- Well-managed with sildenafil 100mg, though with headache side effects\n- Likely multifactorial etiology including hypogonadism and vascular factors\n\n PLAN:\n\n1. Elevated PSA:\n   - Repeat PSA in 3 months to assess trend\n   - Consider prostate biopsy if PSA continues to rise or exceeds 6.0 ng/mL\n   - Discussed risks/benefits of biopsy versus continued monitoring; patient prefers monitoring at this time\n\n2. Secondary Hypogonadism:\n   - Given consistently low free testosterone and normal LH/FSH, will initiate testosterone replacement therapy\n   - Prescribed testosterone cypionate 200mg/mL, 1mL IM every 2 weeks\n   - Discussed risks including potential PSA increases, polycythemia, and cardiovascular effects\n   - Will monitor PSA, CBC, CMP, and testosterone levels 3 months after initiating therapy\n   - Patient counseled on administration technique\n\n3. Erectile Dysfunction:\n   - Continue sildenafil 100mg as needed\n   - Discussed alternative PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil, vardenafil) that might cause fewer headaches\n   - Patient prefers to continue current medication for now\n   - Testosterone replacement may improve erectile function\n\n4. Return to clinic in 3 months with repeat PSA, testosterone levels (total and free), CBC, and CMP\n   - Sooner if new symptoms develop\n\nPatient verbalizes understanding of the plan and all questions were addressed during today's visit.\n",

He has been sexually active with high-risk behaviors but is currently on doxycycline PrEP for STI prevention, and recent testing shows no active STIs.\n\n\nProblem #1: Peyronie's disease with penile pain - Continue pentoxifylline. Patient has tried conservative management with limited success.\n\nProblem #2: Erectile dysfunction - Continue sildenafil 100mg as needed. Despite headaches, patient reports better efficacy with sildenafil compared to tadalafil.\n\nProblem #3: History of STIs - Continue STI prevention measures including doxycycline PrEP.\n\n\nPLAN:\n1. Continue current medications including pentoxifylline for Peyronie's disease and sildenafil for ED\n2. Consider referral to specialized Peyronie's disease clinic for additional treatment options including:\n   a. Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum injections\n   b. Surgical options if conservative measures fail\n3. Continue current STI prevention measures\n4. PSA remains stable - continue annual screening\n5. Return to clinic in 6 months to reassess symptoms or sooner if new concerns arise\n",

He was started on testosterone cypionate 200mg IM every 14 days on February 5, 2025, for hypogonadism with a baseline testosterone level of 137.43 ng/dL. Today he presents for follow-up of his TRT and other urologic conditions.\n\nThe patient reports feeling better since starting TRT, with improved energy levels and sexual drive, though erectile dysfunction persists. Recent labs show elevated estrogen levels at 353 pg/mL (normal 56-213), suggesting peripheral aromatization of testosterone to estrogen. His testosterone remains low (105 ng/dL) despite treatment. He continues to use a vacuum erection device (VED) for ED with some success, though he notes it's \"not ideal.\" \n\nRegarding his BPH with LUTS, he continues to have significant urinary symptoms, with a stable IPSS score of 18/35. He previously did not tolerate tamsulosin due to orthostatic hypotension and discontinued finasteride due to lack of improvement. He has also been unable to tolerate alfuzosin.\n\nFor his recurrent nephrolithiasis, imaging from February 2024 showed a stable 7mm nonobstructing left renal calculus. He denies current flank pain, hematuria, or dysuria. Previous 24-hour urine collection revealed hyperoxaluria, high urinary sodium, and elevated calcium oxalate risk.\n\n+---------------+------+\n|        IPSS          |\n+---------------+------+\n| Symptom       | 6/30 |\n+---------------+------+\n| Empty         |  3   |\n| Frequency     |  3   |\n| Urgency       |  3   |\n| Hesitancy     |  1   |\n| Intermittency |  3   |\n| Flow          |  2   |\n| Nocturia      |  3   |\n+---------------+------+\n| Total         | 18/35|\n| BI            | 3/6  |\n+---------------+------+\n\nDIETARY HISTORY:\nNo coffee consumption, but occasionally drinks Dr. Pepper (1-3 cans a week), though he has been decreasing his intake. Doesn't eat chocolate. Likes spicy foods. Doesn't drink alcohol. Following low sodium, low oxalate diet for kidney stone prevention.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nFormer smoker (4 years), quit in 1992. Married. Retired truck driver.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\nNo history of cancer.\n\nSEXUAL HISTORY:\nHas erectile dysfunction. Currently using vacuum erection device with some success but still getting accustomed to it. The constriction ring is pretty tight, but erections are still not lasting long enough. Unable to use PDE5 inhibitors due to concurrent nitroglycerin use.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. BPH with LUTS\n2. Recurrent nephrolithiasis\n3. Erectile dysfunction\n4. Hypogonadism\n5.

His testosterone level remains low despite TRT, with elevated estrogen levels suggesting peripheral aromatization. His urinary symptoms are significant and multifactorial, and he has been unable to tolerate medical therapy for BPH. His nephrolithiasis is stable, and he continues with dietary modifications. His ED is being managed with a vacuum erection device with moderate success.\n\nProblem #1: Hypogonadism with suboptimal response to testosterone replacement therapy. Low testosterone (105 ng/dL) and elevated estrogen (353 pg/mL) despite being on testosterone cypionate 200mg IM every 14 days since February 2025.\n\nProblem #2: BPH with LUTS. Persistent moderate symptoms (IPSS 18/35) and inability to tolerate medical therapy due to side effects.\n\nProblem #3: Recurrent nephrolithiasis. Stable 7 mm left renal calculus with hyperoxaluria and high urinary sodium on previous 24-hour urine collection.\n\nPLAN:\n\n1. Hypogonadism:\n   - Adjust testosterone dosing regimen to address suboptimal response: increase testosterone cypionate to 250mg IM every 14 days.\n   - Add anastrozole 0.5mg twice weekly to address elevated estradiol levels from peripheral aromatization.\n   - Check comprehensive hormone panel in 12 weeks including total and free testosterone, estradiol, FSH, LH, SHBG, CBC, CMP.\n   - Continue monitoring PSA every 3-6 months while on TRT.\n   - Educate patient on potential side effects of TRT and anastrozole.\n\n2. BPH with LUTS:\n   - Given inability to tolerate medical therapy, proceed with scheduling cystoscopy and urodynamic studies to evaluate for possible surgical intervention.\n   - Obtain cardiology clearance prior to any surgical intervention given cardiovascular history.\n   - Continue to encourage dietary modifications that may help urinary symptoms (limiting caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods).\n   - Discuss realistic expectations regarding potential surgical options (TURP/HoLEP).\n\n3. Recurrent Nephrolithiasis:\n   - Continue dietary modifications (low sodium, low oxalate).\n   - Encourage fluid intake >2.5 L/day.\n   - Repeat 24-hour urine collection in 3 months.\n   - Renal ultrasound in 6 months to monitor stone burden.\n   - Consider empiric potassium citrate therapy to increase urinary citrate levels and inhibit stone formation.\n\n4. Erectile Dysfunction:\n   - Continue with vacuum erection device.\n   - Reassess efficacy and discuss techniques for optimal use.\n   - Consider intracavernosal injection therapy or urethral suppositories as alternatives if VED efficacy remains suboptimal.\n   - Discuss influence of TRT adjustments on erectile function.\n\n5. Follow-Up:\n   - Return to clinic in 12 weeks for testosterone level check and comprehensive evaluation of all urologic conditions.\n   - Continue close follow-up with PCP for blood pressure management.\n   - Call clinic for any worsening urinary symptoms, hematuria, flank pain, or concerns with testosterone therapy.\n   - Provided VA Urology clinic phone number for questions or concerns.\n",

He has a 3.8 cm right upper pole renal mass that has shown interval growth from 3.2 cm on prior imaging. Given his comorbidities, active surveillance has been the management approach with scheduled renal MRI for continued monitoring. His PSA shows a gradual increase over the past several years from 0.34 to 3.26 ng/mL, though still within normal range. His BPH symptoms appear stable on current medical therapy with finasteride and tamsulosin.\n\n Problem #1: Right Renal Mass\nActive surveillance for 3.8 cm right upper pole renal mass. Patient has scheduled renal MRI follow-up planned for June 2025 with subsequent urology appointment. Given patient's multiple medical comorbidities, continued surveillance is appropriate at this time. Advised patient about warning signs that would require urgent evaluation (gross hematuria, significant flank pain, unexplained weight loss, etc.).\n\n Problem #2: BPH with LUTS\nStatus post greenlight laser procedure approximately 10 years ago with current moderate symptoms (IPSS 15/35). Currently managed on tamsulosin 0.4mg BID and finasteride 5mg daily with stable symptoms. Will continue current medical therapy as patient reports symptomatic improvement.\n\n Problem #3: Rising PSA\nPSA has gradually increased from 0.34 in 2019 to 3.26 in July 2024, though remains within normal range. This may be due to BPH progression given lack of suspicious findings on prostate exam. Will continue to monitor PSA with follow-up testing in 6 months.\n\n PLAN:\n1. Continue active surveillance for right renal mass with MRI scheduled for June 2025\n2. Follow-up appointment after MRI to review results and management options\n3. Continue tamsulosin 0.4mg BID and finasteride 5mg daily for BPH\n4. Repeat PSA in 6 months\n5. Continue to coordinate care with cardiology given patient's recent cardiac interventions and anticoagulation management\n6. Advised patient to contact office for any worsening urinary symptoms, hematuria, or flank pain\n7. Return to clinic after MRI in June 2025 or sooner if symptoms arise\n",

Additionally, all patients should ensure an adequate \n       intake of dietary calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (400-800 IU \n       daily).  \n        \n       2.  The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) guidelines\n       recommend initiating therapy to reduce fracture risk in\n       postmenopausal women or men over age 50 with BMD: - T-score below\n       -2.5 SD; - or T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD if the 10-year\n       probability of hip fracture is >3% or a 10-year probability of a\n       major osteoporosis-related fracture is >20% based on the\n       U.S.-adapted WHO algorithm; - or presence of a fragility\n       fracture.  \n        \n       3. Patients with diagnosed cases of osteoporosis or low bone\n       density (osteopenia) should be regularly tested for bone mineral\n       density.  For patients eligible for Medicare, routine testing is\n       allowed once every 2 years.  Testing frequency can be increased\n       for patients with rapidly progressing disease, or for those who\n       are receiving medical therapy to restore bone mass.  \n        \n       COMMENTS: \n        \n       The technical quality of the study is good.  \n \n     Primary Diagnostic Code: \n \n Primary Interpreting Staff:\n   DIANE M ICENOGLE-LEUSCHEN, MD RADIOLOGIST (Verifier)\n /DMI\n \n    \nFacility: AUDIE L.

Based\n       on the United States FRAX calculator, the patient's 10 year\n       probability of major osteoporotic fracture is 7.8% and 10 year\n       probability of hip fracture is 2.0%. \n        \n       According to the World Health Organization guidelines,\n       osteoporosis may be diagnosed if the lowest T-score of the lumbar\n       spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or less.  Low bone\n       density (osteopenia) may be diagnosed if the T-score falls\n       between -1.0 and -2.5.  In certain circumstances the 33% radius\n       (also called 1/3rd radius) may be utilized.  \n        \n       Osteoporosis may be diagnosed in men age 50 and older if the\n       T-score of the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck is -2.5 or\n       less.  \n        \n       RECOMMENDATIONS: \n        \n       1.  If therapy is contemplated, mild to aggressive therapies are \n       available.  Additionally, all patients should ensure an adequate \n       intake of dietary calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (400-800 IU \n       daily).  \n        \n       2.  The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) guidelines\n       recommend initiating therapy to reduce fracture risk in\n       postmenopausal women or men over age 50 with BMD: - T-score below\n       -2.5 SD; - or T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD if the 10-year\n       probability of hip fracture is >3% or a 10-year probability of a\n       major osteoporosis-related fracture is >20% based on the\n       U.S.-adapted WHO algorithm; - or presence of a fragility\n       fracture.  \n        \n       3. Patients with diagnosed cases of osteoporosis or low bone\n       density (osteopenia) should be regularly tested for bone mineral\n       density.  For patients eligible for Medicare, routine testing is\n       allowed once every 2 years.  Testing frequency can be increased\n       for patients with rapidly progressing disease, or for those who\n       are receiving medical therapy to restore bone mass.  \n        \n       COMMENTS: \n        \n       The technical quality of the study is good.  \n \n     Primary Diagnostic Code: \n \n Primary Interpreting Staff:\n   DIANE M ICENOGLE-LEUSCHEN, MD RADIOLOGIST (Verifier)\n /DMI\n \n    \nFacility: AUDIE L.

IMAGING:
Renal Ultrasound (12/01/2025):
- Right kidney: 11.2 cm, normal cortical thickness, no hydronephrosis or masses
- Left kidney: 10.8 cm, normal cortical thickness, no hydronephrosis or masses
- Bladder: Incompletely visualized, recommend cystoscopy

ASSESSMENT:
1. Gross hematuria - concerning for bladder pathology given age, risk factors
2. Lower urinary tract symptoms - likely BPH-related
3. Elevated PSA - trending upward, family history of prostate cancer

PLAN:
1. Cystoscopy scheduled for 12/13/2025 to evaluate bladder and rule out malignancy
2. Urine cytology pending - will review results
3. Consider prostate MRI if PSA continues to rise
4. CT urogram to evaluate upper tracts
5. Continue current medications
6. Follow-up in 2 weeks after cystoscopy
7. Patient educated about warning signs, importance of follow-up

DISCUSSED:
- Differential diagnosis including bladder cancer, BPH, prostatitis, kidney stones
- Need for thorough workup given hematuria
- Procedural risks and benefits of cystoscopy
- Patient verbalized understanding and agreed to plan

Follow-up: 2 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen

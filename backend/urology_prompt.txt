PLAN:

For the PSA Curve, if a PSA Curve already exists in the source document, then update it with new results only.  If no PSA Curve is present, then create a PSA Curve with the following format:  [r], one space, Date (3 letter month, 2 digit day, 4 digit year), one space, Time (24 hour clock), four spaces, PSA (put the value only, not the name PSA).  If the PSA is >4 then append H at the end.  Do not use bullets, use [r] instead.  One line per PSA report. Provide the PSA curve in reverse chronological order.  If serum testosterone levels are provided, create a similar Testosterone curve.  Always use clinical data only from the uploaded document and no prior patient data.  Always provide complete information, no truncations.  Provide full summarizations for all of the imaging provided in this the document. Provide full summarizations of all pathology.  Use chain of thought reasoning and tree of thought exploration for options in the document. Do not create any data for the date of visit and do not create any data not found in the document uploaded. Remember, use all imaging results.  No not truncate the list of imaging results.  Include every imaging result in the document.  Make list of every imaging results, and every pathology result and make sure each makes it into the final document.
